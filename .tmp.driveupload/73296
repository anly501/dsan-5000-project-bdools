The purpose of the study is to demonstrate superior clinical outcomes at 90 days with Trevo Retriever plus medical management compared to medical management al1 in appropriately selected stroke patients treated six to 24 hours after last seen well (for cases of unknown time of onset). The Trevo Retriever indication within the DAWN Trial, for use in patients treated six to 24 hours after last seen well, is currently under an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE), and the submission for expanding the indication for the later time window is pending. Raw Materials and Inventory Raw materials essential to our business are generally readily available from multiple sources; however, certain of our raw materials are currently sourced from single suppliers. Substantially all products we manufacture are stocked in inventory, while certain MedSurg products are assembled to order. Patents and Trademarks Patents and trademarks are significant to our business to the extent that a product or an attribute of a product represents a unique design or process. Patent protection of such products restricts competitors from duplicating these unique designs and features. We seek to obtain patent protection on our products whenever appropriate for protecting our competitive advantage. On December 31, 2018 we owned approximately 3,068 United States patents and approximately 4,716 international patents. Seasonality Our business is generally not seasonal in nature; however, the number of orthopaedic implant surgeries is typically lower in the summer months, and sales of capital equipment are generally higher in the fourth quarter. Competition In each of our product lines we compete with local and global companies. The development of new and innovative products is important to our success in all areas of our business. Competition in research involving the development and improvement of new and existing products and processes is particularly significant. The competitive environment requires substantial investments in continuing research and maintaining sales forces. We believe our commitment to innovation, quality and service and our reputation differentiates us in the highly competitive product categories in which we operate and enables us to compete effectively. We believe that our competitive position in the future will depend to a large degree on our ability to develop new products and make improvements to existing products. Regulation Our businesses are subject to varying degrees of governmental regulation in the countries in which we operate, and the general trend is toward increasingly stringent regulation. In the United States the Medical Device Amendments of 1976 to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and its subsequent amendments and the regulations issued and proposed thereunder provide for regulation by the FDA of the design, manufacture and marketing of medical devices, including most of our products. Many of our new products fall into FDA classifications that require notification submitted as a 510(k) and review by the FDA before we begin marketing them. Certain of our products require extensive clinical testing, consisting of safety and efficacy studies, followed by pre market approval (PMA) applications for specific surgical indications. Certain of our products also fall under the FDA's drug classification, as well as other FDA classifications. The FDA's Quality System regulations set forth standards for our product design and manufacturing processes, require the maintenance of certain records and provide for inspections of our facilities by the FDA. There are also certain requirements of state, local and foreign governments that must be complied with in the manufacture and marketing of our products. The member states of the European Union (EU) adopted the European Medical Device Directives, which form a single set of medical device regulations for all EU member countries. These regulations require companies that wish to manufacture and distribute medical devices in EU member countries to meet certain quality system requirements and obtain CE marking for their products. We have authorization to apply the CE marking to substantially all of our products. In addition, the EU enacted the EU Medical Device Regulation (EU MDR) in May 2017 with an effective date of May 2020, which imposes stricter requirements for the marketing and sale of medical devices, including in the areas of clinical evaluation requirements, quality systems, labeling and post market surveillance. Finally, we are required to comply with the unique regulatory requirements of each of the countries in Europe and other countries, including China, in which we market our products. Initiatives to limit the growth of general healthcare expenses and hospital costs are ongoing in the markets in which we do business. These initiatives are sponsored by government agencies, legislative bodies and the private sector and include price regulation and competitive pricing. It is not possible to predict at this time the long term impact of such cost containment measures on our future business. In addition, business practices in the healthcare industry are scrutinized, particularly in the United States, by federal and state government agencies. The resulting investigations and prosecutions carry the risk of significant civil and criminal penalties. Environment We are subject to various rules and regulation in the United States and internationally related to the protection of human health and the environment. Our operations involve the use of substances regulated under environmental laws, primarily in manufacturing and sterilization processes. We believe our policies, practices and procedures are properly designed to comply, in all material respects, with applicable environmental laws and regulations. We do not expect compliance with these requirements to have a material effect on purchases of property, plant and equipment, cash flows, net earnings or competitive position. Employees On December 31, 2018 we had approximately 36,000 employees globally. Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified. 2 STRYKER CORPORATION 2018 FORM 10 K Executive Officers As of January 31, 2019 Name Age Title First Became an Executive Officer Kevin A.

All SEC filings are also available at the SEC's website at www.sec.gov . ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS. This report contains statements that are not historical facts and are considered "forward looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are based on current projections about operations, industry conditions, financial condition and liquidity. Words that identify forward looking statements include words such as "may," "could," "will," "should," "possible," "plan," "predict," "forecast," "potential," "anticipate," "estimate," "expect," "project," "intend," "believe," "may impact," "on track," "goal," "strategy" and words and terms of similar substance used in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance, an acquisition or our businesses. In addition, any statements that refer to expectations, projections or other characterizations of future events or circumstances, including any underlying assumptions, are forward looking statements. Those statements are not guarantees and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual results could differ materially and adversely from these forward looking statements. Some important factors that could cause our actual results to differ from our expectations in any forward looking statements include the risks discussed below. Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties discussed below that could materially and adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem not to be material may also materially and adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition or results of operations. LEGAL AND REGULATORY RISKS Current economic and political conditions make tax rules in jurisdictions subject to significant change Our future results of operations could be affected by changes in the effective tax rate as a result of changes in tax laws, regulations and judicial rulings. In December 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 was signed into law in the United States. We are continuing to evaluate the impact of tax reform as new guidance and regulations are published. In addition, further changes in the tax laws of foreign jurisdictions could arise, including as a result of the base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) project undertaken by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). The OECD, which represents a coalition of member countries, has issued recommendations that, in some cases, would make substantial changes to numerous long standing tax positions and principles. These contemplated changes, to the extent adopted by OECD members and or other countries, could increase tax uncertainty and may adversely affect our provision for income taxes. The impact of United States healthcare reform legislation on our business remains uncertain In 2010 the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) was enacted. While the provisions of the ACA are intended to expand access to health insurance coverage and improve the quality of healthcare over time, other provisions of the legislation, including Medicare provisions aimed at decreasing costs, comparative effectiveness research, an independent payment advisory board and pilot programs to evaluate alternative payment methodologies, are having a meaningful effect on the way healthcare is developed and delivered and could have a significant effect on our business. Among other things, the ACA imposed a 23 percent excise tax on medical devices that applies only to United States sales, which are a majority of our medical device sales. Congress suspended the excise tax for 2016 and 2017. The suspension was once again upheld in January 2018 for 2 years. If the excise tax is not repealed or further suspended, the tax will adversely impact future results of operations after the current suspension expires in December 2019. We also face uncertainties that might result from modification or repeal of any of the provisions of the ACA, including as a result of current and future executive orders and legislative actions. We cannot predict what other healthcare programs and regulations will ultimately be implemented at the federal or state level or the effect of any future legislation or regulation in the United States may have on our business. We are subject to extensive governmental regulation relating to the manufacturing, labeling and marketing of our products The manufacturing, labeling and marketing of our products are subject to extensive and evolving regulations and rigorous regulatory enforcement by the FDA, European Union (EU), the Safe Food and Drug Administration (SFDA) in China, and other governmental authorities in the United States and internationally. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals to market a medical device can be costly and time consuming and approvals might not Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified. 3 STRYKER CORPORATION 2018 FORM 10 K be granted timely. We have ongoing responsibilities under the laws and regulations applicable to the manufacturing of products within our facilities and those contracted by third parties that are subject to periodic inspections by the FDA and other governmental authorities to determine compliance with the quality system, medical device reporting regulations and other requirements. Costs to comply with regulations, including the EU Medical Device Regulation enacted by the EU in May 2017 and effective in May 2020, and the regulatory laws established by the SFDA in China, and costs associated with remediation can be significant. If we fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, we may be subject to a range of sanctions, including substantial fines, warning letters that require corrective action, product seizures, recalls, the suspension of product manufacturing, revocation of approvals, exclusion from future participation in government healthcare programs, substantial fines and criminal prosecution. We are subject to federal, state and foreign healthcare regulations, including anti bribery and anti corruption laws, and could face substantial penalties if we fail to comply with such regulations and laws The relationships that we and our distributors and others that market our products have with healthcare professionals, such as physicians and hospitals, are subject to scrutiny under various state and federal laws often referred to collectively as healthcare fraud and abuse laws. In addition, the United States and foreign government regulators have increased the enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti bribery laws. We also must comply with a variety of other laws that protect the privacy of individually identifiable healthcare information and impose extensive tracking and reporting related to all transfers of value provided to certain healthcare professionals. These laws and regulations are broad in scope and are subject to evolving interpretation and we have in the past been, and in the future could be, required to incur substantial costs to monitor compliance or to alter our practices. Violations of these laws may be punishable by criminal or civil sanctions, including substantial fines, imprisonment of current or former employees and exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs. We are subject to data privacy and protection regulations and laws globally, and could face substantial penalties if we fail to comply with such regulations and laws We are subject to a variety of laws and regulations globally regarding privacy, data protection, and data security, including those related to the collection, storage, handling, use, disclosure, transfer, and security of personal data. For example, Europe General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which became effective in May 2018, applies to all of our activities related to products and services that we offer to EU customers and employees. The GDPR established new requirements regarding the handling of personal data and includes significant penalties for non compliance (including possible fines of up to 4% of total company revenue). Other governmental authorities around the world are considering similar types of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection, which could impose significant limitations and increase our cost of providing our products and services where we process end user personal data. These laws and regulations are broad in scope and are subject to evolving interpretation and we have in the past been, and in the future could be, required to incur substantial costs to monitor compliance or to alter our practices. We may be adversely affected by product liability claims, unfavorable court decisions or legal settlements We are exposed to potential product liability risks inherent in the design, manufacture and marketing of medical devices, many of which are implanted in the human body for long periods of time or indefinitely. We are currently defendants in a number of product liability matters, including those relating to our Rejuvenate and ABGII Modular Neck hip stems and LFIT Anatomic CoCr V40 Femoral Heads discussed in Note 7 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. These matters are subject to many uncertainties and outcomes are not predictable. In addition, we may incur significant legal expenses regardless of whether we are found to be liable. We are self insured for product liability related claims and expenses. Intellectual property litigation and infringement claims could cause us to incur significant expenses or prevent us from selling certain of our products The medical device industry is characterized by extensive intellectual property litigation and, from time to time, we are the subject of claims of infringement or misappropriation. Regardless of outcome, such claims are expensive to defend and divert management and operating personnel from other business issues. A successful claim or claims of patent or other intellectual property infringement against us could result in payment of significant m1tary damages and or royalty payments or negatively impact our ability to sell current or future products in the affected category. Dependence on patent and other proprietary rights and failing to protect such rights or to be successful in litigation related to such rights may impact offerings in our product portfolios Our long term success largely depends on our ability to market technologically competitive products. If we fail to obtain or maintain adequate intellectual property protection, it could allow others to sell products that directly compete with proprietary features in our product portfolio. Also, our issued patents may be subject to claims challenging their validity and scope and raising other issues. In addition, currently pending or future patent applications may not result in issued patents. MARKET RISKS We have exposure to exchange rate fluctuations on cross border transactions and translation of local currency results into United States Dollars We report our financial results in United States Dollars and approximately 30% of our net sales are denominated in foreign currencies, including the Australian Dollar, British Pound, Euro and Japanese Yen. Cross border transactions with external parties and intercompany relationships result in increased exposure to foreign currency exchange effects. While we use derivative instruments to manage the impact of currency exchange, our hedging strategies may not be successful, and our unhedged exposures continue to be subject to currency fluctuations. In addition, the weakening or strengthening of the United States Dollar results in favorable or unfavorable translation effects when the results of our foreign locations are translated into United States Dollars. Additional capital that we may require in the future may not be available to us or may only be available to us on unfavorable terms Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including operating requirements, current and future acquisitions and the need to refinance existing debt. Our ability to issue additional debt or enter into other financing arrangements on acceptable terms could be adversely affected by our debt levels, unfavorable changes in economic conditions or uncertainties that affect the capital markets. Changes in credit ratings issued by nationally recognized credit rating agencies could also adversely affect our access to and cost of financing. Higher borrowing costs or the inability to access capital markets could adversely affect our ability to support future growth and operating requirements. BUSINESS AND OPERATIONAL RISKS We are subject to cost containment measures in the United States and other countries resulting in pricing pressures Initiatives to limit the growth of general healthcare expenses and Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified. 4 STRYKER CORPORATION 2018 FORM 10 K hospital costs are ongoing in the markets in which we do business. These initiatives are sponsored by government agencies, legislative bodies and the private sector and include price regulation and competitive pricing. Pricing pressure has also increased due to continued consolidation among healthcare providers, trends toward managed care, the shift toward governments becoming the primary payers of healthcare expenses, reduction in reimbursement levels and medical procedure volumes and government laws and regulations relating to sales and promotion, reimbursement and pricing generally. We operate in a highly competitive industry in which competition in the development and improvement of new and existing products is significant The markets in which we compete are highly competitive. New products and surgical procedures are introduced on an ongoing basis and our present or future products could be rendered obsolete or uneconomical by technological advances by our competitors, who may respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies, undertake more extensive marketing campaigns, have greater financial, marketing and other resources or be more successful in attracting potential customers, employees and strategic partners. We may be unable to maintain adequate working relationships with healthcare professionals We seek to maintain close working relationships with respected physicians and medical personnel in hospitals and universities who assist in product research and development. We rely on these professionals to assist us in the development and improvement of proprietary products. If we are unable to maintain these relationships, our ability to develop, market and sell new and improved products could be adversely affected. We are subject to additional risks associated with our extensive international operations We develop, manufacture and distribute our products globally. Our international operations are subject to additional risks and potential costs, including changes in reimbursement, changes in regulatory requirements, differing local product preferences and product requirements, diminished protection of intellectual property in some countries, trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements, difficulty in staffing and managing foreign operations, and political and economic instability. Our business could be adversely impacted if we are unable to successfully manage these and other risks of international operations in an increasingly volatile environment. We may be unable to capitalize on previous or future acquisitions In addition to internally developed products, we invest in new products and technologies through acquisitions. Such investments are inherently risky, and we cannot guarantee that any acquisition will be successful or will not have a material unfavorable impact on us. The risks include the activities required and resources allocated to integrate new businesses, diversion of management time that could adversely affect management's ability to focus on other projects, the inability to realize the expected benefits, savings or synergies from the acquisition, the loss of key personnel and exposure to unexpected liabilities of acquired companies. In addition, we cannot be certain that the businesses we acquire will become or remain profitable. We may incur goodwill impairment charges related to 1 or more of our business units We perform our annual impairment test for goodwill in the fourth quarter of each year, or more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist. In evaluating the potential for impairment we make assumptions regarding revenue projections, growth rates, cash flows, tax rates and discount rates. These assumptions are uncertain and by nature may vary from actual results. A significant reduction in the estimated fair values could result in impairment charges. We could be negatively impacted by future changes in the allocation of income to each of the income tax jurisdictions in which we operate We operate in multiple income tax jurisdictions both in the United States and internationally. Accordingly, our management must determine the appropriate allocation of income to each jurisdiction based on current interpretations of complex income tax regulations. Income tax authorities regularly perform audits of our income tax filings. Income tax audits associated with the allocation of income and other complex issues, including inventory transfer pricing and cost sharing, product royalty and foreign branch arrangements, may require an extended period of time to resolve and may result in significant income tax adjustments. We could experience a failure of a key information technology system, process or site or a breach of information security, including a cybersecurity breach or failure of 1 or more key information technology systems, ne2rks, processes, associated sites or service providers We rely extensively on information technology (IT) systems to conduct business. In addition, we rely on ne2rks and services, including internet sites, cloud and SaaS solutions, data hosting and processing facilities and tools and other hardware, software and technical applications and platforms, some of which are managed, hosted, provided and or used by third parties or their vendors, to assist in conducting our business. Numerous and evolving cybersecurity threats pose potential risks to the security of our IT systems, ne2rks and product offerings, as well as the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data. A security breach, whether of our products, of our customers ne2rk security and systems or of third party hosting services, could impact the use of such products and the security of information stored therein. While we have made investments seeking to address these threats, including monitoring of ne2rks and systems, hiring of experts, employee training and security policies for employees and third party providers, the techniques used in these attacks change frequently and may be difficult to detect for periods of time and we may face difficulties in anticipating and implementing adequate preventative measures. If our IT systems are damaged or cease to function properly, the ne2rks or service providers we rely upon fail to function properly, or we or 1 of our third party providers suffer a loss or disclosure of our business or stakeholder information due to any number of causes ranging from catastrophic events or power outages to improper data handling or security breaches and our business continuity plans do not effectively address these failures on a timely basis, we may be exposed to reputational, competitive and business harm as well as litigation and regulatory action. An inability to successfully manage the implementation of our new global enterprise resource planning (ERP) system could adversely affect our operations and operating results We are in the process of implementing a new global ERP system. This system will replace many of our existing operating and financial systems. Such an implementation is a major undertaking, both financially and from a management and personnel perspective. Any disruptions, delays or deficiencies in the design and implementation of our new ERP system could adversely affect our ability to process orders, ship products, provide services and customer support, send invoices and track payments, fulfill contractual obligations or otherwise operate our business. We may be unable to attract and retain key employees Our sales, technical and other key personnel play an integral role in the development, marketing and selling of new and existing products. If we are unable to recruit, hire, develop and retain a talented, Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified. 5 STRYKER CORPORATION 2018 FORM 10 K competitive work force, we may not be able to meet our strategic business objectives. Interruption of manufacturing operations could adversely affect our business We and our suppliers have manufacturing sites all over the world; however, the manufacturing of certain of our product lines is concentrated in 1 or more plants or geographic regions. Orthopaedics has principal manufacturing and distribution facilities in the United States in New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Florida and outside the United States in China, Ireland, Netherlands, Switzerland, Germany and the United Kingdom. MedSurg has principal manufacturing and distribution facilities in the United States in Michigan, California, Illinois, Indiana, Washington, Florida and Texas and outside the United States in Ireland, Germany, Mexico, Puerto Rico, Switzerland, Turkey, France and the United Kingdom. Neurotechnology and Spine has principal manufacturing and distribution facilities in Illinois, Indiana, Utah, Pennsylvania and California and outside the United States in China, Ireland, France, Switzerland and Netherlands. Damage to these facilities as a result of natural disasters or otherwise, as well as issues in our manufacturing arising from a failure to follow specific internal protocols and procedures, compliance concerns relating to the quality systems regulation, equipment breakdown or malfunction or other factors, could adversely affect the availability of our products. In the event of an interruption in manufacturing, we may be unable to move quickly to alternate means of producing affected products to meet customer demand. In the event of a significant interruption, we may experience lengthy delays in resuming production of affected products due to the need for regulatory approvals. We may experience loss of market share, additional expense and harm to our reputation. We use a variety of raw materials, comp1nts or devices in our global supply chains, production and distribution processes; significant shortages or price increases could increase our operating costs, require significant capital expenditures, or adversely impact the competitive position of our products Our reliance on certain suppliers to secure raw materials, comp1nts and finished devices exposes us to product shortages and unanticipated increases in prices. In addition, several raw materials, comp1nts, and finished devices are procured from a sole source due to the quality considerations, unique intellectual property considerations or constraints associated with regulatory requirements. If sole source suppliers are acquired or were unable or unwilling to deliver these materials, we may not be able to manufacture or have available 1 or more products during such period of unavailability and our business could suffer. In certain cases we may not be able to establish additional or replacement suppliers for such materials in a timely or cost effective manner, largely as a result of FDA and other regulations that require, among other things, validation of materials and comp1nts prior to their use in our products.
