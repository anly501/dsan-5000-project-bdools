Item 1 Business Cost of product sales is comprised of (1) costs to produce and acquire products sold to customers; (2) royalty payments under license agreements granting us rights to sell related products; and (3) direct and indirect distribution costs incurred in the sale of products. We acquired the rights to sell our commercial products through license and assignment agreements with the developers of these products, as described in Cost of Product Sales Total revenues are reported net of (1) estimated rebates; (2) prompt pay discounts; (3) allowances for product returns or exchanges; and (4) distributor fees. We estimate our liability for rebates based on an analysis of historical levels of rebates by product to both state Medicaid agencies and commercial third party payers relative to sales of each product. In addition, we determine our obligation for prescription drug discounts required for Medicare Part D patients within the coverage gap based on estimations of the number of Medicare Part D patients and the period such patients will remain within the coverage gap. We provide prompt pay discounts to customers that pay amounts due within a specific time period and base our estimates for prompt pay discounts on observed customer payment behavior. We derive estimates relating to the allowance for returns of Adcirca from published industry data specific to specialty pharmaceuticals and will continue to do so until we have sufficient historical data on which to base our allowance. In addition, we compare patient prescription data for Adcirca to sales of Adcirca on a quarterly basis to ensure a reasonable relationship between prescription and sales trends. To date, we have not identified any unusual patterns in the volume of prescriptions relative to sales that would warrant reconsideration of, or adjustment to, the methodology we currently employ to estimate our allowance for returns. The allowance for exchanges for Remodulin is based on the historical rate of product exchanges, which has been too immaterial to record. In addition, because Tyvaso is distributed in the same manner and under similar contractual arrangements as Remodulin, the level of product exchanges for Tyvaso has been comparable to that of Remodulin and we anticipate minimal exchange activity in the future for both products. Lastly, we estimate distributor fees based on contractual rates for specific services applied to the estimated units of service provided for the period. materially impact our business, but will continue to monitor future developments related to this legislation. Table of Contents 61 We were not materially impacted by the Acts during 2010 and our revenues were reduced by less than 1 percent in 2011 as a result of the Acts. However, the potential long term impact of the Acts on our business is inherently difficult to predict as many details regarding the implementation of this legislation have not yet been determined. Presently, we have not identified any provisions that could On January 1, 2011, certain provisions of the Acts that address the coverage gap in the Medicare Part D prescription drug program (commonly known as the "donut hole") became effective. Under these provisions, drug manufacturers are required to provide a 50 percent discount on branded prescription drugs to patients receiving reimbursement under Medicare Part D while they remain in this coverage gap. These provisions of the Acts apply to Adcirca, which is our only commercial pharmaceutical product covered by Medicare Part D. Approximately 35 percent of our Adcirca patients are covered under Medicare Part D. The vast majority of our Remodulin and Tyvaso Medicare patients are covered under Medicare Part B, which does not contain a similar coverage gap. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively, the Acts) contains broad provisions that will be implemented over the next several years. We are continually evaluating the impact of the Acts on our business; however, our evaluation is dependent upon the issuance of final regulations and the impact this legislation will have on insurance companies and their relationships with drug manufacturers. We require our distributors to maintain reasonable levels of contingent inventory at all times as the interruption of Remodulin or Tyvaso therapy can be life threatening. Consequently, sales of these therapies in any given quarter may not precisely reflect patient demand. Our distributors typically place monthly orders based on estimates of future demand and considerations of contractual minimum inventory requirements. As a result, sales volume of Remodulin and Tyvaso can vary, depending on the timing and magnitude of these orders. Sales of Remodulin comprise the largest share of our revenues. Other significant sources of revenues include sales of Tyvaso and Adcirca. Sales of Tyvaso and Adcirca have continued to grow since their commercial introduction in 2009, as each of these therapies has gained broader market acceptance. We sell Remodulin and Tyvaso in the United States to our specialty pharmaceutical distributors Accredo Health Group, Inc., CuraScript, Inc. and CVS Caremark. Adcirca is sold to pharmaceutical wholesalers that are part of Lilly's pharmaceutical wholesaler ne2rk. We also sell Remodulin to distributors outside of the United States. On July 21, 2011, Express Scripts, Inc., the parent company of CuraScript, announced the signing of a merger agreement with Medco Health Solutions, Inc., the parent company of Accredo. The parties announced that the merger, which is subject to regulatory and shareholder approvals, is expected to close in the first half of 2012 Presently, we do not expect the merger, if approved, to materially affect our business. Revenues to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10 K for details. Sale of Medicomp, Inc. Note 18 We sold Medicomp, Inc., our former telemedicine subsidiary, to a group of private investors on March 31, 2011 In addition, in June 2011, we discontinued all of our continuing telemedicine related activities. Accordingly, the results of Medicomp, Inc., including the gain recognized on its disposal, have been included in discontinued operations for each of the 3 years in the 3 year period ended December 31, 2011 on our consolidated statements of operations. Refer to approval of Tyvaso, an inhaled therapy for the treatment of PAH. We launched both of these products for commercial sale during the third quarter of 2009. These 2 products enable us to offer treatments to a broader range of patients who suffer from PAH. In addition, we are continuing to develop oral formulations of treprostinil and beraprost MR, both for the treatment of PAH. Table of Contents 60 (AFSSAPS) for the intravenous use of Remodulin to treat PAH. The AFSSAPS approval follows a review period during which 22 European Economic Area member nations, each of which had previously approved subcutaneous Remodulin through the mutual recognition process, reviewed and endorsed the final variation assessment report issued by AFSSAPS, which will allow the marketing of intravenous Remodulin in those nations. Our other commercial products include Adcirca (tadalafil) tablets (Adcirca) and Tyvaso (treprostinil) Inhalation Solution (Tyvaso). In May 2009, the FDA approved Adcirca, an orally administered therapy for the treatment of PAH to which we acquired certain exclusive commercialization rights from Eli Lilly and Company (Lilly). In July 2009, we received FDA Agence Fran aise de S curit Sanitaire des Produits de Sant We concentrate substantially all of our research and development efforts on these key therapeutic programs. Our lead product is Remodulin (treprostinil) Injection (Remodulin) for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) initially approved Remodulin in 2002 for subcutaneous (under the skin) administration. The FDA subsequently broadened its approval of Remodulin in 2004 for intravenous (in the vein) use and for the treatment of patients requiring transition from Flolan , the first drug approved by the FDA for the treatment of PAH. Remodulin has also been approved in various countries outside of the United States. In most of these countries, Remodulin has been approved for both routes of administration. We announced in December 2011 that we received regulatory approval by the French regulatory agency, a cell based product known as PLacental eXpanded (PLX) cells being studied for the treatment of pulmonary hypertension. Cell Based Therapy a novel class of small, sugar like molecules that have shown antiviral activity in a range of pre clinical settings; and Glycobiology antiviral agents antibodies that treat cancer by activating the immune system; Monoclonal antibodies for oncologic applications (Ch14.18 MAb and 8H9 MAb) a molecule that acts to inhibit the degradation of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) in cells. cGMP is activated by nitric oxide, a naturally occurring substance in the body that mediates the relaxation of vascular smooth muscle; Phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE 5) inhibitor (Adcirca ) stable synthetic forms of prostacyclin, an important molecule produced by the body that has powerful effects on blood vessel health and function; Prostacyclin analogues (Remodulin , Tyvaso , oral treprostinil and beraprost MR) Our key therapeutic products and product candidates include Overview included in this Annual Report on Form 10 K and factors described in other cautionary statements, cautionary language and risk factors set forth in other documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
