Item 1 Business All references to we, our, and us in this Annual Report refer to Quidel Corporation and its subsidiaries. Overview We have a leadership position in the development, manufacturing and marketing of rapid diagnostic testing solutions. These diagnostic testing solutions primarily include applications in infectious diseases, women health and gastrointestinal diseases. We sell our products directly to end users and distributors, in each case, for professional use in physician offices, hospitals, clinical laboratories, reference laboratories, leading universities, retail clinics and wellness screening centers. We market our products in the United States through a ne2rk of national and regional distributors, and a direct sales force. Internationally, we sell and market primarily in Japan and Europe through distributor arrangements. We commenced our operations in 1979 and launched our first products, dipstick based pregnancy tests, in 1983 Since such time, our product base and technology platforms have expanded through internal development and acquisitions of other products, technologies and companies. Our diagnostic solutions aid in the detection and diagnosis of many critical diseases and other medical conditions, including infectious diseases, women health, autoimmune diseases, b1 health, thyroid diseases, and fecal occult blood. In February 2010, we expanded our operations through the acquisition of DHI, a privately held, in vitro diagnostics ( IVD ) company, based in Athens, Ohio. DHI is a market leader in the manufacturing and commercialization of FDA cleared direct fluorescent IVD assays used in hospitals and reference laboratories for a variety of diseases, including certain viral infections and thyroid diseases. 2 We are a corporation, incorporated in the State of Delaware. Our executive offices are located at 10165 McKellar Court, San Diego, California 92121, and our teleph1 number is (858) 552 1100. This Annual Report and each of our other periodic and current reports, including any amendments thereto, are available, free of charge, on our website, www.quidel.com , as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC. The information contained on our website is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report and should not be considered part of this Annual Report. In addition, the SEC website contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information about us at www.sec.gov . Business Strategy Our primary objective is to build a broader based diagnostic company, with products in market segments that are growing, and in which we have significant expertise and know how, and, in doing so, to realize increased shareholder value. Our diagnostic testing solutions are designed to provide specialized results that serve a broad range of customers, by addressing varying requirements of ease of use, reduced cost, increased test accuracy and reduced time to result. Our current approach to address this diagnostic continuum relative to our strategy is comprised of 3 parts Rapid point of care immunoassay tests for use in physician offices, hospital laboratories and emergency departments, retail clinics, and other urgent care settings; direct fluorescent assays ( DFA ) and culture based tests for the clinical virology laboratory; and molecular diagnostic tests across a number of laboratory segments. Our strategy to accomplish our primary objective includes the following leveraging our current infrastructure to develop and launch new lateral flow and DFA products such as additional assays for our FDA approved Sofia Analyzer; developing a molecular diagnostics franchise that incorporates 2 distinct testing platforms, AmpliVue and Savanna ; and strengthening our position with distribution partners and our customers to gain more emphasis on our products in the U.S. and abroad. Our current initiatives to execute this strategy include the following continue to focus our research and development efforts on 3 areas new proprietary product platform development, the creation of improved products and new products for existing markets and unmet clinical needs, and pursuit of collaborations with other companies for new and existing products and markets that advance our differentiated strategy; provide clinicians with validated studies that encompass the clinical efficacy and economic efficiency of our diagnostic tests for the professional market; continue to focus on strengthening our market and brand leadership in infectious diseases and women health by acquiring and or developing and introducing clinically superior diagnostic solutions; strengthening our direct sales force to create direct relationships with integrated delivery ne2rks, laboratories and hospitals, with a goal of driving growth through improved physician and laboratorian satisfaction; support payer evaluation of diagnostic tests and establishment of favorable reimbursement rates; continue to create strong global alliances to support our efforts to achieve leadership in key markets and expand our presence in emerging markets; and further refine our manufacturing efficiencies and productivity improvements to improve profit, with continued focus on profitable products and markets and our effort to create a core competency in new product development. 3 Product development activities are inherently uncertain, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain approval for any of our products, or if we obtain approval, that we will commercialize any of our products. In addition, we may terminate our development efforts with respect to 1 or more of our products under development at any time, including before or during clinical trials. The Overall Market for In Vitro Diagnostics Customers for IVD products are primarily centralized laboratories and physician offices and other decentralized non institutional settings. Centralized testing market The centralized diagnostic testing process typically involves obtaining a specimen of blood, urine or other sample from the patient and sending the sample from the healthcare provider office or hospital unit to a central laboratory. In a typical visit to the physician office, after the patient test specimen is collected, the patient is usually sent home and receives the results of the test several hours or days later. The result of this process is that the patient may leave the physician office without confirmation of the diagnosis and the opportunity to begin potentially more effective immediate care. Decentralized POC market Point of care ( POC ) testing for certain diseases has become an accepted adjunct to central laboratory and self testing. The professional POC market is comprised of 2 general segments decentralized testing in non institutional settings, such as physicians offices, and hospital testing (e.g., emergency rooms and bedside). Hospital POC testing is accepted and growing and is generally an extension of the hospital central laboratory. Hospitals in the U.S. have progressively sought to reduce the length of patient stays and, consequently, the proportion of cases seen as outpatients have increased. If the U.S. experience is representative of future trends, emergency departments and other critical care units such as intensive care units, operating rooms, trauma and cardiac centers are increasingly becoming the principal centers for the management of moderate and severe acute illness. Out of hospital testing sites consist of physicians office laboratories, nursing homes, pharmacies, retail clinics and other non institutional, ambulatory settings in which healthcare providers perform diagnostic tests. This decentralized POC market encompasses a large variety of IVD products ranging from moderate sized instrumented diagnostic systems serving larger group practices to single use, disposable tests. We believe POC testing is increasing due to its clinical benefit, fast results, cost effectiveness and patient satisfaction. We believe that the growth in POC testing is in part due to evolving technological improvements creating high quality tests with laboratory accuracy and POC ease of use, some of which are capable of being granted a waiver under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 ( CLIA ). Products We provide diagnostic testing solutions under various brand names, including, among others, the following QuickVue , QuickVue+ , Quidel , MicroVue , FreshCells , D 3 FastPoint , Super E Mix , ELVIS , Sofia , Quidel Molecular, Amplivue , and Thyretain . Our diagnostic testing solutions address the following medical and wellness categories Infectious Diseases QuickVue Influenza. Our QuickVue influenza tests are rapid, qualitative tests for the detection of the viral antigens of influenza type A and B, the 2 most common types of the influenza virus. Our first QuickVue influenza test received FDA clearance in September 1999, with commercialization beginning in December 1999. The FDA granted us the 4 first CLIA waiver for an influenza test in October 2000. Our second generation test, the QuickVue Influenza A+B test, which allows for the differential diagnosis of influenza type A and type B, received FDA clearance in September 2003 and a CLIA waiver in February 2004. Group A Strep . Our QuickVue Strep A tests are intended for the rapid, qualitative detection of Group A Streptococcal antigen from throat swabs or confirmation of presumptive Group A Streptococcal colonies recovered from culture. The tests are used to aid in the diagnosis of Group A Streptococcal infection. Each year millions of people in the U.S. are tested for Group A Strep infections, commonly referred to as strep throat. Group A Streptococci are bacteria that typically cause illnesses such as tonsillitis and pharyngitis which, if left untreated, can progress to secondary complications. Our initial Strep A test, the QuickVue In line Strep A test, was the first rapid Strep A test to be granted a CLIA waiver, and we launched additional product offerings with the QuickVue + Strep A and the QuickVue Dipstick Strep A tests in 1996 and 2001, respectively. RSV Test. Our QuickVue RSV test is a rapid immunoassay for Respiratory Syncitial Virus ( RSV ). The majority of upper respiratory tract infections in children are caused by viruses and RSV is generally recognized as a frequent agent responsible for these infections. We launched our RSV test during the fourth quarter of 2006, and we received CLIA waiver in February 2008. In September 2010, we received 510(k) clearance for the sale of our QuickVue RSV 10 test. QuickVue RSV 10 detects the RSV antigen directly from nasopharyngeal swab and nasopharyngeal aspirate wash specimens from symptomatic patients under the age of six. QuickVue RSV 10 employs the identical test method and sample preparation of our QuickVue Influenza A+B test, allowing for the use of the same nasopharyngeal patient specimen when testing for influenza or an RSV infection. Multiplex Respiratory. Our cell culture and DFA detection solutions are used by reference laboratories, public health labs and acute care hospitals to detect seven major viral respiratory pathogens. Our proprietary cell culture platform R Mix combined with our FDA cleared antibody kit D 3 Ultra DFA, detects Influenza A and B, RSV, Adenovirus and Parainfluenza types 1, 2 and 3, with turn around times between 16 and 48 hours. The same D 3 Ultra DFA antibody kit can also be used for direct specimen testing for those viruses with turn around times in less than 90 minutes. In 2009, we introduced a new FDA cleared technology called D 3 FastPoint that detects eight viruses, with Human Metapnuemo Virus added to the testing menu. D 3 FastPoint provides laboratories, in a direct specimen testing format, the ability to produce virus identification in less than 25 minutes from specimen receipt. General Virology . We provide a wide variety of traditional cell lines, specimen collection devices, media and controls for use in laboratories that culture and test for normal human viruses. We provide cell based products under the FreshCells brand in multiple different formats, including tubes, shell vials and multi well plates. Herpes and Herpes Family. Our proprietary engineered cell culture system, ELVIS HSV, is an FDA cleared and highly sensitive system for the isolation and detection of Herpes Simplex Virus ( HSV ) types 1 and 2 Herpes is a widespread sexually transmitted infection with an HSV 2 prevalence rate of 16% of the population according to the Centers for Disease Control ( CDC ). We also provide a multiplex cell culture solution using a propriety cell platform called H&V Mix that is used to isolate HSV, Varicella Zoster Virus and Cytomegalovirus, all in the herpes family of viruses. Antibody detection and identification of each of these viruses can be performed with FDA cleared antibody products provided under the D 3 DFA brand. Sofia Analyzer. Sofia is the brand name for our update to include our next generation fluorescent immunoassay ( FIA ) system. The easy to use Sofia Analyzer, Sofia Influenza A+B FIA test, and Sofia Strep A FIA test combine unique software and fluorescent chemistry to yield an automatic, objective result that is readily available on the instrument screen, in a hard copy printout, and in a transmissible electronic form that can ne2rk via a lab information system ( LIS ) to hospital and medical center databases. The Sofia FIA test employs advanced lateral flow and immunofluorescence technologies to provide enhanced performance for Influenza A and B, Strep A, RSV, and Legi1lla. The Sofia Analyzer provides for different operational modes to accommodate both small and large laboratories as well as other features designed to facilitate use in a variety of healthcare settings, including hospitals, medical centers, and small clinics. These features help ensure a reliable, objective, rapid and accurate diagnostic result. In late 2011, we received 510(k) clearance from the FDA and the European Conformity Mark ( CE Mark ) in Europe for the sale of the Sofia Analyzer and the Sofia Influenza A+B FIA. Also in 2011, we also received the CE Mark in Europe for the Sofia Strep A FIA test. 5 In 2012, we received the CE Mark in Europe for the Sofia Legi1lla FIA test and the Sofia RSV FIA test. Also in 2012, we received CLIA Waiver for our Sofia Analyzer and the Sofia Influenza A+B FIA test. Molecular Open Box. These assays run on the Applied Biosystems 7500 Fast DX thermocycler or the Cepheid SmartCycler thermocycler. They are the first of several planned Quidel Molecular Real Time PCR Assays that provide important benefits to the customer, including, among others, room temperature storage, reduced process time, and ready to use reagent configurations. In 2011, we received 510(k) clearance and the CE Mark for the sale of the Quidel Molecular Influenza A+B Real Time RT PCR Assay and the Quidel Molecular Human Metapneumovirus ( hMPV ) Assay. In 2012, we received CE Mark for our Molecular Diagnostic Test for RSV and hMPV. In 2012, we received 510(k) clearance for our Quidel Molecular Influenze A+B assay. Also in 2012, we received CE Mark for our Direct Specimen Rapid PCR Test for Toxigenic Clostridium Difficile. Molecular Amplivue Hand Held Molecular Diagnostic. For this assay, the detection of the pathogen is achieved using a hand held, fully contained cassette that combines isothermal Helicase Dependent Amplification (HDA) with its lateral flow detection technology. In 2012, we received 510(k) clearance and the CE Mark for Amplivue Hand Held Molecular Diagnostic Test for Clostridium Difficile. POC Women Health Pregnancy. Our QuickVue pregnancy tests are used in both physicians office labs and acute care settings. In August 2010, we received 510(k) clearance for the sale of our RapidVue hCG test which is a lateral flow pregnancy test. The early detection of pregnancy enables the physician and patient to institute proper care, helping to promote the health of both the woman and the developing embryo. Our QuickVue and RapidVue pregnancy tests are sensitive immunoassay tests for the qualitative detection of human Chorionic Gonoadotropin ( hCG ) in serum or urine for the early detection of pregnancy. Graves Disease. Our FDA cleared bioassay called Thyretain is used for the differential diagnosis of an autoimmune disease called Graves Disease. Graves Disease is caused by antibodies that stimulate the thyroid horm1 receptors to create a hyperthyroid condition causing symptoms that include heart palpitations, unexplained weight loss, anxiety, depression and fatigue. Graves Disease is considered the most common autoimmune disorder in the U.S. according to an article published in the New England Journal of Medicine and it predominantly affects women. Thyretain is sold to reference laboratories and select acute care hospitals and has been successfully deployed on automated testing platforms. Chlamydia. Our QuickVue Chlamydia test is a lateral flow immunoassay for the rapid, qualitative detection of Chlamydia trachomatis from endocervical swab and cytology brush specimens. The test is intended for use as an aid in the presumptive diagnosis of Chlamydia. Chlamydia trachomatis is responsible for the most widespread sexually transmitted disease in the U.S. Over 1 half of infected women do not have symptoms and, if left untreated, Chlamydia trachomatis can cause sterility. B1 Health. Osteoporosis is a systemic skeletal disease characterized by low b1 mass and deterioration of the micro architecture of b1 tissue, with a consequent increase in b1 fragility and susceptibility to fractures. The risk for fracture increases exp1ntially with age. A key set of parameters in the monitoring of osteoporosis, both before and after therapy, are biochemical markers of b1 metabolism. As a leader in the field of b1 markers, we produce both clinical and research products for the assessment of osteoporosis and the evaluation of b1 resorption formation, which, including our metabolic b1 markers, are used by physicians to monitor the effectiveness of therapy in pharmaceutical and related research. 6 Gastrointestinal Diseases Immunoassay fecal occult blood. Our QuickVue test is a rapid, fecal immunochemical test ( FIT ) intended to detect the presence of blood in stool specimens. Blood in the stool is an indication of a number of gastrointestinal disorders, including colorectal cancer. We launched our first FIT test in late December 2005. Enterovirus. Enteroviruses reproduce initially in the gastrointestinal tract before spreading to other organs such as the nervous system, heart and skin. Enteroviruses can also infect the respiratory tract. Enteroviruses such as Coxsackievirus A16 are referred to as Hand Foot and Mouth disease and commonly affect infants and children. Our indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) products sold under the name Super E Mix and D 3 IFA Enterovirus kit are used by reference laboratories and acute care hospitals. Helicobacter pylori ( H. pylori ). H. pylori is the bacterium associated with approximately 80% of patients diagnosed with peptic ulcers in the U.S. H. pylori is implicated in chronic gastritis and is recognized by the World Health Organization as a Class 1 carcinogen that may increase a person risk of developing stomach cancer. Once an H. pylori infection is detected, antibiotic therapy is administered to eradicate the organism and effect a cure of the ulcer. Our rapid test is a serological test that measures antibodies circulating in the blood caused by the immune response to the H. pylori bacterium. Our initial test was the first rapid H. pylori test to be granted a CLIA waiver. We launched our second generation CLIA waived test, the QuickVue H. Pylori gII test, in August 2000. Our Specialty Products Group ( SPG ) located in Santa Clara, California develops diagnostic and research products in the fields of oncology, b1 health and autoimmune disease. Assays are developed on a microwell platform and are currently marketed to clinicians and researchers. SPG is strategically focused on identifying and demonstrating clinical utility around these markers in a variety of disease states. In the area of autoimmune disease, we have developed Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay ( ELISA ) based assays and reagents for the detection of activation products from the 3 main complement pathways. We currently sell these products both directly and through select distributors throughout the world under the Quidel and MicroVue brands. The SPG revenues, income and assets are less than 10% of our overall operations. Seasonality Sales of our infectious disease products are subject to, and significantly affected by, the seasonal demands of the cold and flu seasons, prevalent during the fall and winter. As a result of these seasonal demands, we typically experience lower sales volume in the second and third quarters of the calendar year, and have higher sales in the first and fourth quarters of the calendar year. Historically, sales of our infectious disease products have varied from year to year based in large part on the severity, length and timing of the onset of the cold and flu season. For the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, sales of our infectious disease products accounted for 71%, 71% and 61%, respectively, of total revenue. Research and Development We continue to focus our research and development efforts on 3 areas new proprietary product platform development, the creation of improved products and new products for existing markets and unmet clinical needs, and pursuit of collaborations with other companies for new and existing products and markets that advance our differentiated strategy. Research and development expenses were approximately $27.7 million, $26.3 million and $237 million for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. We anticipate that we will continue to devote a significant amount of financial resources to product and technology research and development for the foreseeable future. Marketing and Distribution Our business strategy is designed around serving the continuum of healthcare delivery needs starting with the POC clinicians located in small doctor office practices to moderately complex physician office laboratories ( POL ) through the highly complex environment in hospital and clinical reference laboratories. 7 Within the inherent operational diversity of these various segments, we focus on ensuring market leadership and providing points of differentiation by specializing in the diagnosis and monitoring of selected disease states. Our marketing strategy includes ensuring that our key product portfolios are supported by clinical validation and health economic and outcomes research that show hospitals, laboratories, acute care facilities and POC clinicians that these tests deliver fast, high quality results, are cost effective to use, and improve patient outcomes. Our distribution strategy needs to accommodate the fact that, the U.S. POC market is highly fragmented, with many small or medium sized customers. A ne2rk of national and regional distributors is utilized, combined with our own sales force, to reach customers using POC diagnostic tests. We have developed priority status with several of the major distributors in the U.S., resulting in many of our products having preferred product status with these distributors. The sales, distribution and service of our highly complex diagnostic tests are controlled exclusively by us. Since the acquisition of DHI and the integration of the hospital sales forces of the 2 companies, laboratory end users in hospitals and clinical reference laboratories utilizing our highly complex diagnostic tests are reached through our own direct sales force and technical support services that have specialized training and understanding of the product portfolio. Internationally, the use of professional rapid POC diagnostic tests, the acceptance of testing outside the central laboratory, the regulatory requirements to sell POC tests and consumer interest in over the counter and self test products, differ considerably from the U.S. Our international sales are significantly lower than domestic sales, largely due to the POC market being more developed in the U.S. relative to the overall IVD market in other countries. During 2012, we continued to invest in several key areas support for clinical research and expanding our communications through promotional campaigns, peer reviewed technical publications, professional shows and exhibits, symposia, medical education and support of health economics and outcomes research. We derive a significant portion of our total revenue from a relatively small number of distributors. Four of our distributors, which are considered to be among the market leaders, collectively accounted for approximately 42%, 40% and 31% of our total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. We had sales to 2 distributors for whom sales exceeded 10% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2012 The distributors were Cardinal Healthcare Corporation and McKesson Corporation. See Note 7. Industry and Geographic Information in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report. Manufacturing In 2012, we had manufacturing operations in San Diego and Santa Clara, California and Athens, Ohio. The San Diego facility produces our lateral flow, immunoassay products. The Santa Clara facility manufactures our microtiter plate products and our molecular products. The Athens facility manufactures our cell cultures and monoclonal antibody kits. The San Diego facility consists of laboratories devoted to tissue culture, cell culture, protein purification and immunochemistry and production areas dedicated to manufacturing and assembly. In the manufacturing process, biological and chemical supplies and equipment are used. Since the year 2000, the San Diego and Santa Clara facilities have operated under a Quality Management System certified to the International Organization for Standardization ( ISO ) 9001 certification. During 2005, we became certified to the ISO 134852003 Regulatory Standard as required for medical device manufacturers distributing product within the European Union and other countries. Many of the lateral flow and immunoassay products manufactured in our San Diego, California facility are packaged and shipped by a local third party. The Athens facility consists of clean rooms (FS 209E Class 1000 ISO Class 6) for the culturing and dispensing of cell cultures under cGMP conditions. The facility also has laboratories devoted to tissue culture for the production of monoclonal antibodies. In the manufacturing process, biological and chemical supplies are used, as well as specialized equipment. The facility is also certified to the ISO 134852003 medical device standard. Packaging and shipping logistics are also handled at the facility. We seek to conduct all of our manufacturing in compliance with the FDA Quality System Regulations ( QSR ) (formerly Good Manufacturing Practices) governing the manufacture of medical devices. Our manufacturing facilities have been registered with the FDA and the Department of Health Services of the State of California (the State FDA ), and have passed routine federal and state inspections confirming compliance with the QSR regulatory requirements. 8 Government Regulation Regulation in the United States The testing, manufacture and commercialization of our products are subject to regulation by numerous governmental authorities, principally the FDA and corresponding state and foreign regulatory agencies. Pursuant to the U.S. Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder, the FDA regulates the preclinical and clinical testing, manufacture, labeling, distribution and promotion of medical devices. Noncompliance with applicable requirements can result in, among other matters, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, failure of the FDA to grant premarket clearance or premarket approval for devices, withdrawal of marketing clearances or approvals and criminal prosecution. The FDA also has the authority to request a recall, repair, replacement or refund of the cost of any device manufactured or distributed in the U.S. if the device is deemed to be unsafe. In the U.S., devices are classified into 1 of 3 classes (Class I, II or III) on the basis of the controls deemed necessary by the FDA to reasonably ensure their safety and effectiveness. Class I and II devices are subject to general controls including, but not limited to, performance standards, premarket notification ( 510(k) ) and postmarket surveillance. Class III devices generally pose the highest risk to the patient and are typically subject to premarket approval to ensure their safety and effectiveness. Our current products are all Class I or II. Prior to commercialization in the U.S. market, manufacturers must obtain FDA clearance through a premarket notification or premarket approval process, which can be lengthy, expensive and uncertain. The FDA has been requiring more rigorous demonstration of product performance as part of the 510(k) process, including submission of extensive clinical data. It generally takes from 3 to six months to obtain clearance but may take longer. A premarket approval application must be supported by valid scientific evidence to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the device, typically including the results of clinical investigations, bench tests and reference laboratory studies. In addition, modifications or enhancements for existing products that could significantly affect safety or effectiveness, or constitute a major change in the intended use of the device, will require new submissions to the FDA. On January 30, 2008, the FDA issued guidance entitled Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff Recommendation for CLIA waiver applications. The guidance sets forth new requirements for obtaining a CLIA waiver that are 1rous and will increase the time and cost required to obtain a CLIA waiver. Any devices we manufacture or distribute pursuant to FDA clearance or approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA and certain state agencies, including adherence to QSR relating to testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance requirements. We must also comply with Medical Device Reporting ( MDR ) requirements mandating reporting to the FDA of any incident in which a device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or in which a device malfuncti1d and, if the malfunction were to recur, would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury. Labeling and promotional activities are also subject to scrutiny by the FDA and, in certain circumstances, by the Federal Trade Commission. Current FDA enforcement policy prohibits the marketing of approved medical devices for unapproved uses. Regulation Outside of the United States For marketing outside the U.S., we are subject to foreign regulatory requirements governing human clinical testing and marketing approval for our products. These requirements vary by jurisdiction, differ from those in the U.S., and may require us to perform additional or different preclinical or clinical testing regardless of whether FDA approval has been obtained. The amount of time required to obtain necessary approvals may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. In many foreign countries, pricing and reimbursement approvals are also required. Our initial focus for obtaining marketing approval outside the U.S. is typically the European Union (the EU ) and Japan. EU Regulations and Directives generally classify health care products either as medicinal products, medical devices or in vitro diagnostics. The CE Mark certification requires us to receive ISO certification for the manufacture of our products. This certification comes only after the development of an all inclusive quality system, which is reviewed for compliance with ISO standards by a licensed body working within the EU. After certification is received, a technical file is developed which attests to the product compliance with EU directive 98 79 EC for in vitro diagnostic medical devices. Only after this point is the product CE marked. The Japanese regulations require registration of in vitro diagnostic products with the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare. Additional clinical trials are typically required for registration purposes. For products marketed in Canada, we have our independent party certification under the Canadian Medical Device Regulation. 9 Intellectual Property The healthcare industry has traditionally placed considerable importance on obtaining and maintaining patent and trade secret protection for commercially relevant technologies, devices, products and processes. We and other companies engaged in research and development of new diagnostic products actively pursue patents for technologies that are considered novel and patentable. However, important factors, many of which are not within our control, can affect whether and to what extent patent protection in the U.S. and in other important markets worldwide is obtained. By way of example, the speed, accuracy and consistency in application of the law in a patent office within any particular jurisdiction is beyond our control and can be unpredictable. The resolution of issues such as these and their effect upon our long term success is likewise indeterminable. We have issued patents, both in the U.S. and internationally, with expiration dates ranging from the present through approximately 2029 and have patent applications pending throughout the world. It has been our policy to file for patent protection in the U.S. and other countries with significant markets, such as Western European countries and Japan, if the economics are deemed to justify such filing and our patent counsel advises that relevant patent protection may be obtained. A large number of individuals and commercial enterprises seek patent protection for technologies, products and processes in fields in or related to our areas of product development. To the extent such efforts are successful, we may be required to obtain licenses and pay significant royalties in order to exploit certain of our product strategies and avoid a material adverse effect on our business. Licenses may not be available to us at all or, if so available, may not be available on acceptable terms. We are aware of certain patents issued to various developers of diagnostic products with potential applicability to our diagnostic technology. We have licensed certain rights from certain companies to assist with the manufacturing of certain products. In the future, we expect that we will require or desire additional licenses from other parties in order to refine our products further and to allow us to develop, manufacture and market commercially viable or superior products effectively. We seek to protect our trade secrets and technology by entering into confidentiality agreements with employees and third parties (such as potential licensees, customers, strategic partners and consultants). In addition, we have implemented certain security measures in our laboratories and offices. Also, to the extent that consultants or contracting parties apply technical or scientific information independently developed by them to our projects, disputes may arise as to the proprietary rights to such data. Under many of our contractual agreements, we have agreed to indemnify the contracting party against costs and liabilities arising out of any patent infringement claims and other intellectual property claims asserted by a third party relating to products sold under those agreements. Competition Competition in the development and marketing of IVD products is intense, and innovation, product development, regulatory clearance to market and commercial introduction of new IVD technologies can occur rapidly. We believe that some of the most significant competitive factors in the rapid diagnostic market include convenience, speed to result, specimen flexibility, product menu, price, reimbursement and product performance as well as the effective distribution, advertising, promotion and brand name recognition of the marketer. The competitive factors in the central laboratory market are also significant and include price, product performance, reimbursement, compatibility with routine specimen procurement methods, and manufacturing products in testing formats that meet the workflow demands of larger volume laboratories. We believe our success will depend on our ability to remain abreast of technological advances, to develop, gain regulatory clearance and introduce technologically advanced products, to effectively market to customers a differentiated value proposition represented by our commercialized products, to maintain our brand strength and to attract and retain experienced personnel, who are in great demand. The majority of diagnostic tests requested by physicians and other healthcare providers are performed by independent clinical reference laboratories. These laboratories, we expect, will continue to compete vigorously to maintain their dominance of the testing market. In order to achieve market acceptance for our products, we will be required to continue to demonstrate that our products provide physicians and central laboratories cost effective and time saving alternatives to competitive products and technologies. Many of our current and prospective commercial competitors, including several large pharmaceutical and diversified healthcare companies, have substantially greater financial, marketing and other resources than we have. These competitors include, among others, Alere Inc. ( Alere ), Beckman Coulter Primary Care Diagnostics ( Beckman ), Fisher Scientific Corporation ( Fisher ), Becton Dickinson and Company ( Becton ), Meridian Bioscience, Inc. ( Meridian ) and Chemicon 10 International, Inc. ( Chemicon ). We also face competition from our distributors since some have created, and others may decide to create, their own products to compete with ours. Competition may also be provided from large, medium and small development companies whose portfolio and technologies are dedicated to the development of diagnostic solutions in areas of infectious diseases in which we currently have relevant market share. Human Resources As of December 31, 2012, we had 514 employees, n1 of whom are represented by a labor union. We have experienced no work stoppages and believe that our employee relations are good.

Item 1A. Risk Factors Risks Related to Our Business Our operating results may fluctuate adversely as a result of many factors that are outside our control. Fluctuations in our operating results, for any reason, could cause our growth or operating results to fall below the expectations of investors and securities analysts. For the year ended December 31, 2012, total revenue decreased 2% to $155.7 million from $158.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 The decrease in total revenues was primarily due to a lack of a cold and flu season in the first quarter of 2012 partially offset by an early start to the 2012 2013 cold and flu season in the fourth quarter of 2012 For further discussion of this increase, refer to Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation included in this Annual Report. We base the scope of our operations and related expenses on our estimates of future revenues. A significant portion of our operating expenses are fixed, and we may not be able to rapidly adjust our expenses if our revenues fall short of our expectations. Our revenue estimates for future periods are based, among other factors, on estimated end user demand for our products. Furthermore, if end user consumption is less than estimated, revenues to our distribution partners would be expected to fall short of expectations. Factors that are beyond our control and that could affect our operating results in the future include seasonal fluctuations in our sales of infectious disease tests, which are generally highest in fall and winter, thus resulting in generally lower operating results in the second and third calendar quarters and higher operating results in the first and fourth calendar quarters; timing of the onset, length and severity of the cold and flu seasons; government and media attention focused on influenza and the related potential impact on humans from novel influenza viruses, such as H1N1 and avian flu; changes in the level of competition, such as would occur if 1 of our larger and better financed competitors introduced a new or lower priced product to compete with 1 of our products; changes in the reimbursement systems or reimbursement amounts that end users rely upon in choosing to use our products; changes in economic conditions in our domestic and international markets, such as economic downturns, decreased healthcare spending, reduced consumer demand, inflation and currency fluctuations; 12 changes in sales levels because a significant portion of our costs are fixed costs, relatively higher sales would be expected to increase profitability, while relatively lower sales would not reduce costs by the same proportion, and could cause operating losses; lower than anticipated market penetration of our new or more recently introduced products; significant quantities of our product or that of our competitors in our distributors inventories or distribution channels; changes in distributor buying patterns; and changes in the health care market including consolidation in our customer base. To remain competitive, we must continue to develop, obtain and protect our proprietary technology rights; otherwise, we may lose market share or need to reduce prices as a result of competitors selling technologically superior products that compete with our products. Our ability to compete successfully in the diagnostic market depends on continued development and introduction of new proprietary technology and the improvement of existing technology. If we cannot continue to develop, obtain and protect proprietary technology, our total revenue and gross profits could be adversely affected. Moreover, our current and future licenses may not be adequate for the operation of our business. Our competitive position is heavily dependent on obtaining and protecting our own proprietary technology or obtaining licenses from others. Our ability to obtain patents and licenses, and their benefits, is uncertain. We have issued patents both in the U.S. and internationally, with expiration dates ranging from the present through approximately 2029. Additionally, we have patent applications pending in various foreign jurisdictions. These pending patent applications may not result in the issuance of any patents, or if issued, may not have priority over others applications or may not offer meaningful protection against competitors with similar technology or may not otherwise provide commercial value. Moreover, any patents issued to us may be challenged, invalidated, found unenforceable or circumvented in the future. In addition to our patents in the U.S., we have patents issued in various other countries including, Australia, Canada, Japan and various European countries, including France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom. Third parties can make, use and sell products covered by our patents in any country in which we do not have patent protection. We also license the right to use our products to our customers under label licenses that are for research purposes only. These licenses could be contested and, because we cannot monitor all potential unauthorized uses of our products around the world, we might not be aware of an unauthorized use or might not be able to enforce the license restrictions in a cost effective manner. In the future, we expect that we will require or desire additional licenses from other parties in order to refine our products further and to allow us to develop, manufacture and market commercially viable or superior products. Also, we may not be able to obtain licenses for technology patented by others and required to produce our products on commercially reasonable terms. To protect or enforce our patent rights, it may be necessary for us to initiate patent litigation proceedings against third parties, such as infringement suits or interference proceedings. These lawsuits would be expensive, take significant time and would divert management attention from other business concerns. In the event that we seek to enforce any of our patents against an infringing party, it is likely that the party defending the claim will seek to invalidate the patents we assert, which could put our patents at risk of being invalidated, held unenforceable, or interpreted narrowly, and our patent applications at risk of not being issued. Further, these lawsuits may provoke the defendants to assert claims against us. If we pursue any such claim, we cannot assure you that we will prevail in any of such suits or proceedings or that the damages or other remedies awarded to us, if any, will be economically valuable. In addition to our patents, we rely on confidentiality agreements and other similar arrangements with our employees and other persons who have access to our proprietary and confidential information, together with trade secrets and other common law rights, to protect our proprietary and confidential technology. These agreements and laws may not provide meaningful protection for our proprietary technology in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of such information or in the event that our competitors independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to ours. Moreover, the laws of some foreign jurisdictions may not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as those in the U.S. In the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of such information, if we encounter difficulties or are otherwise unable to effectively protect our intellectual property rights domestically or in foreign jurisdictions, our business, operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. 13 In order to remain competitive and profitable, we must expend considerable resources to research new technologies and products and develop new markets, and there is no assurance our efforts to develop new technologies, products or markets will be successful or such technologies, products or markets will be commercially viable. We devote a significant amount of financial resources to researching and developing new technologies, new products and new markets. The development, manufacture and sale of diagnostic products require a significant investment of resources. Moreover, no assurances can be given that our efforts to develop new technologies or products will be successful or that such technologies and products will be commercially viable. The development of new markets also requires a substantial investment of resources, such as new employees, offices and manufacturing facilities. Accordingly, we are likely to incur increased operating expenses as a result of our increased investment in sales and marketing activities, manufacturing scale up and new product development associated with our efforts to accomplish our growth strategies discussed in Item 1 of this Annual Report. As a result of any number of risk factors identified in this Annual Report, no assurance can be given that we will be successful in implementing our operational, growth and other strategic efforts. In addition, the funds for our strategic development projects have in the past come primarily from our business operations and a working capital line of credit. If our business slows and we become less profitable, and as a result have less m1y available to fund research and development, we will have to decide at that time which programs to reduce or eliminate, and by how much. Similarly, if adequate financial, personnel, equipment or other resources are not available, we may be required to delay or scale back our strategic efforts. Our operations will be adversely affected if our total revenue and gross profits do not correspondingly increase or if our technology, product and market development efforts are unsuccessful or delayed. Furthermore, our failure to successfully introduce new technologies or products and develop new markets could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects. We rely on a limited number of key distributors which account for a substantial majority of our total revenue. The loss of any key distributor or an unsuccessful effort by us to directly distribute our products could lead to reduced sales. Although we have many distributor relationships in the U.S., the market is dominated by a small number of these distributors. Four of our distributors, which are considered to be among the market leaders, collectively accounted for approximately 42%, 40% and 31% of our total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. We had sales to 2 distributors for whom sales exceeded 10% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2012 In addition, we rely on a few key distributors for a majority of our international sales, and expect to continue to do so for the foreseeable future. The loss or termination of our relationship with any of these key distributors could significantly disrupt our business unless suitable alternatives were timely found or lost sales to 1 distributor are absorbed by another distributor. Finding a suitable alternative to a lost or terminated distributor may pose challenges in our industry competitive environment, and another suitable distributor may not be found on satisfactory terms, if at all. For instance, some distributors already have exclusive arrangements with our competitors, and others do not have the same level of penetration into our target markets as our existing distributors. If total revenue to these or any of our other significant distributors were to decrease in any material amount in the future or we are not successful in timely transitioning business to new distributors, our business, operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. Our operating results are heavily dependent on sales of our influenza diagnostic tests. Although we continue to diversify our products, a significant percentage of our total revenues still continue to come from a limited number of our product families. In particular, revenues from the sale of our influenza tests represent a significant portion of our total revenues and are expected to remain so in at least the near future. In addition, the gross margins derived from sales of our influenza tests are significantly higher than the gross margins from our other core products. As a result, if sales or revenues of our influenza tests decline for any reason whether as a result of market share loss or price pressure, obsolescence, a mild flu season, regulatory matters or any other reason our operating results would be materially and adversely affected on a disproportionate basis. For the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, sales of our infectious disease products (including influenza test sales) accounted for 71%, 71% and 61%, respectively, of total revenue. If we are not able to manage our growth strategy or if we experience difficulties integrating companies or technologies we may acquire after their acquisition, our earnings may be adversely affected. Our business strategy contemplates further growth, which is likely to result in expanding the scope of operating and financial systems and the geographical area of our operations, including further expansion outside the U.S., as new products and technologies are developed and commercialized or new geographical markets are entered. We may experience difficulties integrating the operations of other companies or technologies that we may acquire with our own operations, and as a result we may not realize our anticipated benefits and cost savings within our expected time frame, or at all. Because we have a relatively small executive staff, future growth may also divert management attention from other aspects of our business, and will place a strain on existing management and our operational, financial and management information systems. Furthermore, we may expand into markets in which we have less experience or incur higher costs. We expect to need to execute a number of tasks in a timely, efficient and successful manner in order to realize the benefits and cost savings of acquisitions, including retaining and assimilating key personnel, managing the regulatory and reimbursement approval 14 processes, intellectual property protection strategies and commercialization activities, creating uniform standards, controls, procedures, policies and information systems, including with respect to disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, and meeting the challenges inherent in efficiently managing an increased number of employees potentially in different geographic locations, including the need to implement appropriate systems, policies, benefits and compliance programs. Acquisitions may subject us to other risks, including unanticipated costs and expenditures, potential changes in relationships with strategic partners, potential contractual or intellectual property issues, fluctuations in quarterly results and financial condition as a result of timing of acquisitions and potential accounting charges and write downs, and potential unknown liabilities associated with the strategic combination and the combined operations. Should we encounter difficulties in managing these tasks and risks, our growth strategy may suffer and our revenue and profitability could be adversely affected. Intellectual property risks and third party claims of infringement, misappropriation of proprietary rights or other claims against us could adversely affect our ability to market our products, require us to redesign our products or attempt to seek licenses from third parties, and materially adversely affect our operating results. In addition, the defense of such claims could result in significant costs and divert the attention of our management and other key employees. Companies in or related to our industry often aggressively protect and pursue their intellectual property rights. There are often intellectual property risks associated with developing and producing new products and entering new markets, and we may not be able to obtain, at reasonable cost or upon commercially reasonable terms, if at all, licenses to intellectual property of others that is alleged to be part of such new or existing products. From time to time, we have received, and may continue to receive, notices that claim we have infringed upon, misappropriated or misused other parties proprietary rights. We have hired and will continue to hire individuals or contractors who have experience in medical diagnostics and these individuals or contractors may have confidential trade secret or proprietary information of third parties. We cannot assure you that these individuals or contractors will not use this third party information in connection with performing services for us or otherwise reveal this third party information to us. Thus, we could be sued for misappropriation of proprietary information and trade secrets. Such claims are expensive to defend and could divert our attention and result in substantial damage awards and injunctions that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, to the extent that individuals or contractors apply technical or scientific information independently developed by them to our projects, disputes may arise as to the proprietary rights to such data and may result in litigation. Moreover, in the past we have been engaged in litigation with parties that claim, among other matters, that we infringed their patents. The defense and prosecution of patent and trade secret claims are both costly and time consuming. We or our customers may be sued by other parties that claim that our products have infringed their patents or misappropriated their proprietary rights or that may seek to invalidate 1 or more of our patents. An adverse determination in any of these types of disputes could prevent us from manufacturing or selling some of our products, limit or restrict the type of work that employees involved with such products may perform for us, increase our costs of revenue and expose us to significant liability. As a general matter, our involvement in litigation or in any claims to determine proprietary rights, as may arise from time to time, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations for reasons such as pending litigation may of itself cause our distributors or end users to reduce or terminate purchases of our products; it may consume a substantial portion of our managerial and financial resources; its outcome would be uncertain and a court may find any third party patent claims valid and infringed by our products (issuing a preliminary or permanent injunction) that would require us to withdraw or recall such products from the market, redesign such products offered for sale or under development or restrict employees from performing work in their areas of expertise; governmental agencies may commence investigations or criminal proceedings against our employees, former employees and us relating to claims of misappropriation or misuse of another party proprietary rights; 15 an adverse outcome could subject us to significant liability in the form of past royalty payments, penalties, special and punitive damages, the opposing party attorney fees, and future royalty payments significantly affecting our future earnings; and failure to obtain a necessary license (upon commercially reasonable terms, if at all) upon an adverse outcome could prevent us from selling our current products or other products we may develop. Even if licenses to intellectual property rights are available, they can be costly. We have entered into various licensing agreements, which largely require payments based on specified product sales as well as the achievement of specific milest1s. Royalty and license expenses under these arrangements collectively totaled $9.4 million, $10.9 million and $7.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. We believe we will continue to incur substantial royalty and license expenses relating to future sales of our products and the achievement of specific milest1s. In addition to the foregoing, we may also be required to indemnify some customers, distributors and strategic partners under our agreements with such parties if a third party alleges or if a court finds that our products or activities have infringed upon, misappropriated or misused another person proprietary rights. Further, our products may contain technology provided to us by other parties such as contractors, suppliers or customers. We may have little or no ability to determine in advance whether such technology infringes the intellectual property rights of a third party. Our contractors, suppliers and licensors may not be required or financially able to indemnify us in the event that a claim of infringement is asserted against us, or they may be required to indemnify us only up to a maximum amount, above which we would be responsible for any further costs or damages. Our senior credit facility imposes restrictions on our operations and activities, limits the amount we can borrow, and requires us to comply with various financial covenants. On August 10, 2012, we entered into an amended and restated $140.0 million senior secured syndicated credit facility (the Senior Credit Facility ), which matures on August 10, 2017. The Senior Credit Facility amends and restates our $120.0 million senior secured credit facility dated October 8, 2008. As part of this amendment, we incurred $10 million in deferred financing costs related to the Senior Credit Facility in addition to the $0.6 million we had previously recorded related to the original credit facility. As of December 31, 2012, we had $15 million included as a portion of other non current assets. The Senior Credit Facility bears interest at either on the London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR ) or the base rate plus in each case the applicable margin. The base rate is equal to the highest of (i) the lender prime rate, (ii) the federal funds rate plus 1 half of 1 percent and (iii) LIBOR plus 1 percent. The applicable margin is generally determined in accordance with a performance pricing grid based on our leverage ratio and ranges from 125% to 250% for LIBOR rate loans and from 0.25% to 150% for base rate loans (weighted average interest rate of 146% at December 31, 2012). The agreement governing the Senior Credit Facility is subject to certain customary limitations, including among others limitation on liens; limitation on mergers, consolidations and sales of assets; limitation on debt; limitation on dividends, stock redemptions and the redemption and or prepayment of other debt; limitation on investments (including loans and advances) and acquisitions; limitation on transactions with affiliates; and limitation on disposition of assets. We are also subject to financial covenants which include a funded debt to adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, and stock based compensation ( adjusted EBITDA ) ratio (as defined in the Senior Credit Facility) not to exceed 31 as of the end of each fiscal quarter, and an interest coverage ratio of not less than 31 as of the end of each fiscal quarter. The Senior Credit Facility is secured by substantially all of our present and future assets and properties. If we fail to comply with these covenants, our Senior Credit Facility could become due and payable prior to maturity. As of December 31, 2012 we were in compliance with all financial covenants. We may incur significant additional indebtedness. Our indebtedness could be costly or have adverse consequences. We may incur significant additional indebtedness, subject to the restrictions in our Senior Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2012, we had $110.4 million available under the Senior Credit Facility. Our ability to borrow under the Senior Credit Facility fluctuates from time to time due to, among other factors, our borrowings under the facility and its funded debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio. As of December 31, 2012, we had $5.0 million outstanding under the Senior Credit Facility. Our borrowing capacity can fluctuate from time to time due to, among other factors, our funded debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio as and when measured under the Senior Credit Facility. Our indebtedness could be costly or have adverse consequences, such as requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to payments on our debt; limiting our ability to obtain future financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt obligations and other general corporate requirements; 16 making us more vulnerable to adverse conditions in the general economy or our industry and to fluctuations in our operating results, including affecting our ability to comply with and maintain any financial tests and ratios required under our indebtedness; limiting our flexibility to engage in certain transactions or to plan for, or react to, changes in our business and the diagnostics industry; putting us at a disadvantage compared to competitors that have less relative and or less restrictive debt; and subjecting us to additional restrictive financial and other covenants. We may need to raise additional funds to finance our future capital or operating needs, which could have adverse consequences on our operations and the interests of our stockholders. Seasonal fluctuations in our operating results could limit the cash we have available for research and development and other operating needs or cause us to fail to comply with the financial covenants in the documents governing our indebtedness. As a result, we may need to seek to raise funds through public or private debt or sale of equity to achieve our business strategy or to avoid non compliance with our financial covenants. In addition, we may need funds to complete acquisitions, or may issue equity in connection with acquisitions. If we raise funds or acquire other technologies or businesses through issuance of equity, this could dilute the interests of our stockholders. Moreover, the availability of additional capital, whether debt or equity from private capital sources (including banks) or the public capital markets, fluctuates as our financial condition and industry or market conditions in general change. There may be times when the private capital markets and the public debt or equity markets lack sufficient liquidity or when our securities cannot be sold at attractive prices, in which case we would not be able to access capital from these sources on favorable terms, if at all. We can give no assurance as to the terms or availability of additional capital. Volatility and disruption to the global capital and credit markets may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition, as well as our ability to access credit and the financial soundness of our customers and suppliers. The global capital and credit markets have historically experienced a period of unprecedented turmoil and upheaval, characterized by the bankruptcy, failure, collapse or sale of various financial institutions and an unprecedented level of intervention from the U.S. federal government. These conditions could adversely affect the demand for our products and services and, therefore, reduce purchases by our customers, which would negatively affect our revenue growth and cause a decrease in our profitability. In addition, interest rate fluctuations, financial market volatility or credit market disruptions may limit our access to capital, and may also negatively affect our customers and our suppliers ability to obtain credit to finance their businesses. As a result, our customers needs and ability to purchase our products or services may decrease, and our suppliers may increase their prices, reduce their output or change their terms of sale. If our customers or suppliers operating and financial performance deteriorates, or if they are unable to make scheduled payments or obtain credit, our customers may not be able to pay, or may delay payment of, accounts receivable owed to us, and our suppliers may restrict credit or impose different payment terms or reduce or terminate production of products they supply to us. Any inability of customers to pay us for our products and services, or any demands by suppliers for different payment terms, may adversely affect our earnings and cash flow. Additionally, both state and federal government sponsored and private payers, as a result of budget deficits or reductions, may seek to reduce their health care expenditures by renegotiating their contracts with us. Any reduction in payments by such government sponsored or private payers may adversely affect our earnings and cash flow. Declining economic conditions may also increase our costs. If economic conditions remain volatile, our results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected. We may not achieve market acceptance of our products among physicians and other healthcare providers, and this would have a negative effect on future sales. A large part of our business is based on the sale of rapid POC diagnostic tests that physicians and other healthcare providers can administer in their own facilities without sending samples to central laboratories. Clinical reference laboratories and hospital based laboratories are significant competitors of ours in connection with these rapid POC diagnostic tests and provide a majority of the diagnostic tests used by physicians and other healthcare providers. Our future sales depend on, among other matters, capture of sales from these laboratories by achieving market acceptance of POC testing from physicians and other healthcare providers. If we do not capture sales at the levels in our budget, our total revenue will not grow as much as we expect and the costs we incur or have incurred will be disproportionate to our sales levels. We expect that clinical reference and hospital based laboratories will continue to compete vigorously against our POC diagnostic products in order to maintain and expand their existing dominance of the overall diagnostic testing market. Moreover, even if we can demonstrate that our products are more cost effective, save time, or have better performance , physicians and other healthcare providers may resist changing to POC tests. Our failure to achieve market acceptance from physicians and healthcare providers with respect to the use of our POC diagnostic products would have a negative effect on our future sales growth. 17 The industry and market segment in which we operate are highly competitive, and intense competition with other providers of POC diagnostic products may reduce our sales and margins. In addition to competition from laboratories, our POC diagnostic tests compete with similar products made by our competitors. There are a large number of multinational and regional competitors making investments in competing technologies and products, including several large pharmaceutical and diversified healthcare companies. In addition, there has been a trend toward industry consolidation in our markets over the last few years. We may not be able to compete successfully in an increasingly consolidated industry and cannot predict with certainty how industry consolidation will affect our competitors or us. We expect this trend toward industry consolidation may continue as companies attempt to strengthen or hold their market positions in an evolving industry and as companies are acquired or are unable to continue operations. We also face competition from our distributors as some have created, and others may decide to create, their own products to compete with ours. A number of our competitors have a potential competitive advantage because they have substantially greater financial, technical, research and other resources, and larger, more established marketing, sales, distribution and service organizations than we have. Moreover, some competitors offer broader product lines and have greater name recognition than we have. If our competitors products are more effective than ours or take market share from our products through more effective marketing or competitive pricing, our total revenue and profits could be materially and adversely affected. Our products are highly regulated by various governmental agencies. Any changes to the existing laws and regulations may adversely impact our ability to manufacture and market our products. The testing, manufacture and sale of our products are subject to regulation by numerous governmental authorities in the U.S., principally the FDA and corresponding state and foreign regulatory agencies. The FDA regulates most of our products, which are currently all Class I or II devices. The U.S. Department of Agriculture regulates our veterinary products. Our future performance depends on, among other matters, when and at what cost we will receive regulatory approval for new products. In addition, certain of our foreign product registrations are owned or controlled by our international distribution partners, such that any change in our arrangement with such partners could result in the loss of or delay in transfer of any such product registrations, thereby interrupting our ability to sell our products in those markets. Regulatory review can be a lengthy, expensive and uncertain process, making the timing and costs of clearances and approvals difficult to predict. Our total revenue would be negatively affected by failures or delays in the receipt of approvals or clearances, the loss of previously received approvals or clearances or the placement of limits on the marketing and use of our products. Furthermore, in the ordinary course of business, we must frequently make subjective judgments with respect to compliance with applicable laws and regulations. If regulators subsequently disagree with the manner in which we have sought to comply with these regulations, we could be subjected to substantial civil and criminal penalties, as well as field corrective actions, product recall, seizure or injunction with respect to the sale of our products. The assessment of any civil and criminal penalties against us could severely impair our reputation within the industry and affect our operating results, and any limitation on our ability to manufacture and market our products could also have a material adverse effect on our business. Changes in government policy could adversely affect our business and profitability. Changes in government policy could have a significant impact on our business by increasing the cost of doing business, affecting our ability to sell our products and negatively impacting our profitability. Such changes could include modifications to existing legislation, such as U.S. tax policy, or entirely new legislation, such as the recently adopted healthcare reform bill signed into law in the U.S. Although we cannot fully predict the many ways that health care reform might affect our business, the law imposes a 23% medical device excise tax on certain transactions, including many U.S. sales of medical devices, which will include the majority of our US product sales. This tax took effect January 1, 2013 It is unclear whether and to what extent, if at all, other anticipated developments resulting from health care reform, such as an increase in the number of people with health insurance, may provide us additional revenue to offset this increased tax. If additional revenue does not materialize, or if our efforts to offset the excise tax through spending cuts or other actions are unsuccessful, the increased tax burden will adversely affect our financial performance. We are subject to numerous government regulations in addition to FDA regulation, and compliance with laws, including changed or new laws, could increase our costs and adversely affect our operations. In addition to FDA and other regulations referred to above, numerous laws relating to such matters as safe working conditions, manufacturing practices, environmental protection, fire hazard control and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances impact our business operations. If these laws or their interpretation change or new laws regulating any of our businesses are adopted, the costs of compliance with these laws could substantially increase our overall costs. Failure to comply with any laws, including laws regulating the manufacture and marketing of our products, could result in substantial costs and loss of sales or customers. Because of the number and extent of the laws and regulations affecting our industry, and 18 the number of governmental agencies whose actions could affect our operations, it is impossible to reliably predict the full nature and impact of future legislation or regulatory developments relating to our industry and our products. To the extent the costs and procedures associated with meeting new or changing requirements are substantial, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected. We use hazardous materials in our business that may result in unexpected and substantial claims against us relating to handling, storage or disposal. Our research and development and manufacturing activities involve the controlled use of hazardous materials. Federal, state and local laws and regulations govern the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of hazardous materials. These regulations include federal statutes commonly known as CERCLA, RCRA and the Clean Water Act. Compliance with these laws and regulations is already expensive. If any governmental authorities were to impose new environmental regulations requiring compliance in addition to that required by existing regulations, or alter their interpretation of the requirements of such regulations, such environmental regulations could impair our research, development or production efforts by imposing additional, and possibly substantial, costs, restrictions or compliance procedures on our business. In addition, because of the nature of the penalties provided for in some of these environmental regulations, we could be required to pay sizeable fines, penalties or damages in the event of noncompliance with environmental laws. Any environmental violation or remediation requirement could also partially or completely shut down our research and manufacturing facilities and operations, which would have a material adverse effect on our business. The risk of accidental contamination or injury from these hazardous materials cannot be completely eliminated and exposure of individuals to these materials could result in substantial fines, penalties or damages that are not covered by insurance. Our total revenue could be affected by third party reimbursement policies and potential cost constraints. The end users of our products are primarily physicians and other healthcare providers. In the U.S., healthcare providers such as hospitals and physicians who purchase diagnostic products generally rely on third party payers, principally private health insurance plans, federal Medicare and state Medicaid, to reimburse all or part of the cost of the procedure. Use of our products would be adversely impacted if physicians and other health care providers do not receive adequate reimbursement for the cost of our products by their patients third party payers. Our total revenue could also be adversely affected by changes or trends in reimbursement policies of these governmental or private healthcare payers. We believe that the overall escalating cost of medical products and services has led to, and will continue to lead to, increased pressures on the healthcare industry, both foreign and domestic, to reduce the cost of products and services. Given the efforts to control and reduce healthcare costs in the U.S. in recent years, currently available levels of reimbursement may not continue to be available in the future for our existing products or products under development. Third party reimbursement and coverage may not be available or adequate in either the U.S. or foreign markets, current reimbursement amounts may be decreased in the future and future legislation, regulation or reimbursement policies of third party payers may reduce the demand for our products or adversely impact our ability to sell our products on a profitable basis. Unexpected increases in, or inability to meet, demand for our products could require us to spend considerable resources to meet the demand or harm our reputation and customer relationships if we are unable to meet demand. Our inability to meet customer demand for our products, whether as a result of manufacturing problems or supply shortfalls, could harm our customer relationships and impair our reputation within the industry. This, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business. If we experience unexpected increases in the demand for our products, we may be required to expend additional capital resources to meet these demands. These capital resources could involve the cost of new machinery or even the cost of new manufacturing facilities. This would increase our capital costs, which could adversely affect our earnings and cash resources. If we are unable to develop or obtain necessary manufacturing capabilities in a timely manner, our total revenue could be adversely affected. Failure to cost effectively increase production volumes, if required, or lower than anticipated yields or production problems, including those encountered as a result of changes that we may make in our manufacturing processes to meet increased demand or changes in applicable laws and regulations, could result in shipment delays as well as increased manufacturing costs, which could also have a material adverse effect on our total revenue and profitability. Unexpected increases in demand for our products could also require us to obtain additional raw materials in order to manufacture products to meet the demand. Some raw materials require significant ordering lead time and we may not be able to timely access sufficient raw materials in the event of an unexpected increase in demand, particularly those obtained from a sole supplier or a limited group of suppliers. 19 Interruptions in the supply of raw materials and comp1nts could adversely affect our operations and financial results. Some of our raw materials and comp1nts are currently obtained from a sole supplier or a limited group of suppliers. We have long term supply agreements with many of these suppliers, but these long term agreements involve risks for us, such as our potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of quality raw materials and comp1nts and our reduced control over pricing, quality and timely delivery. It is also possible that 1 or more of these suppliers may become unwilling or unable to deliver materials or comp1nts to us. Any shortfall in our supply of raw materials and comp1nts, and our inability to quickly and cost effectively obtain alternative sources for this supply, could have a material adverse effect on our total revenue or cost of sales and related profits. In addition, we use third party packaging companies to ship our products to customers. An interruption in the businesses of these third party packaging companies could result in a delay of shipments to customers. If 1 or more of our products is claimed to be defective, we could be subject to claims of liability and harm to our reputation that could adversely affect our business. A claim of a defect in the design or manufacture of our products could have a material adverse effect on our reputation in the industry and subject us to claims of liability for injuries and otherwise. Any substantial underinsured loss resulting from such a claim would have a material adverse effect on our profitability and the damage to our reputation or product lines in the industry could have a material adverse effect on our business. We are exposed to business risk which, if not covered by insurance, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. We face a number of business risks, including exposure to product liability claims. Although we maintain insurance for a number of these risks, we may face claims for types of damages, or for amounts of damages, that are not covered by our insurance. For example, although we currently carry product liability insurance for liability losses, there is a risk that product liability or other claims may exceed the amount of our insurance coverage or may be excluded from coverage under the terms of our policy. Also, our existing insurance may not be renewed at the same cost and level of coverage as currently in effect, or may not be renewed at all. Further, we do not currently have insurance against many environmental risks we confront in our business. If we are held liable for a claim against which we are not insured or for damages exceeding the limits of our insurance coverage, whether arising out of product liability matters or from some other matter, that claim could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Our business could be negatively affected by the loss of or the inability to hire key personnel. Our future success depends in part on our ability to retain our key technical, sales, marketing and executive personnel and our ability to identify and hire additional qualified personnel. Competition for these personnel is intense, both in the industry in which we operate and where our operations are located. Further, we expect to grow our operations, and our needs for additional management and other key personnel are expected to increase. If we are not able to retain existing key personnel, or timely identify and hire replacement or additional qualified personnel to meet expected growth, our business could be adversely impacted. We face risks relating to our international sales, including inherent economic, political and regulatory risks, which could impact our financial performance, cause interruptions in our current business operations and impede our growth. Our products are sold internationally, with the majority of our international sales to our customers in Japan and Europe. We currently sell and market our products through distributor organizations and sales agents. Sales to foreign customers accounted for 14%, 14%, and 15% of our total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Our international sales are subject to inherent economic, political and regulatory risks, which could impact our financial performance, cause interruptions in our current business operations and impede our international growth. These foreign risks include, among others compliance with multiple different registration requirements and new and changing registration requirements, our inability to benefit from registration for our products inasmuch as registrations may be controlled by a distributor, and the difficulty in transitioning our product registrations; compliance with complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations, including U.S. laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials, could expose us or our employees to fines and criminal sanctions and damage our reputation; tariffs or other barriers as we continue to expand into new countries and geographic regions; 20 exposure to currency exchange fluctuations against the U.S. dollar; longer payment cycles, generally lower average selling prices and greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection; reduced, or lack of, protection for, and enforcement of, intellectual property rights; political and economic instability in some of the regions where we currently sell our products or that we may expand into in the future; potentially adverse tax consequences; and diversion to the U.S. of our products sold into international markets at lower prices. Currently, the majority of our international sales are negotiated for and paid in U.S. dollars. N1theless, these sales are subject to currency risks, since changes in the values of foreign currencies relative to the value of the U.S. dollar can render our products comparatively more expensive. These exchange rate fluctuations could negatively impact international sales of our products, as could changes in the general economic conditions in those markets. In order to maintain a competitive price for our products internationally, we may have to continue to provide discounts or otherwise effectively reduce our prices, resulting in a lower margin on products sold internationally. Continued change in the values of the Euro, the Japanese Yen and other foreign currencies could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we have a supply agreement with a foreign vendor whereby we evenly share the foreign currency exchange fluctuation risk. We may, in the future, enter into similar arrangements. Investor confidence and our share price may be adversely impacted if we or our independent registered public accounting firm conclude that our internal controls over financial reporting are not effective. As directed by Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002, the SEC adopted rules requiring us, as a public company, to include a report of management on our internal controls over financial reporting in our Annual Reports on Form 10 K that contains an assessment by management of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting. In addition, our independent registered public accounting firm must attest to the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting. The requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 are ongoing. We expect that our internal controls will continue to evolve as our business activities change. Although we seek to diligently and vigorously review our internal controls over financial reporting in an effort to ensure compliance with the Section 404 requirements, any control system, regardless of how well designed, operated and evaluated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that its objectives will be met. In addition, the integration of the business and operations of any future acquisitions could heighten the risk of deficiencies in our internal controls, particularly in the case of acquisitions of private companies, which may not have internal controls over financial reporting adequate for public company reporting. If, during any year, our independent registered public accounting firm is not satisfied with our internal controls over financial reporting or the level at which these controls are documented, designed, operated, tested or assessed, or if the independent registered public accounting firm interprets the requirements, rules or regulations differently than we do, then it may issue a report that is qualified. This could result in an adverse reaction in the financial marketplace due to a loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements and effectiveness of our internal controls, which ultimately could negatively impact the market price of our shares. Risks Related to Our Common Shares Our stock price has been highly volatile, and an investment in our stock could suffer a significant decline in value. The market price of our common shares has been highly volatile and has fluctuated substantially in the past. For example, between December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2012, the closing price of our common shares, as reported by the Nasdaq Global Market, has ranged from a low of $1140 to a high of $18.96. We expect our common shares to continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in price in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control, including the risk factors discussed herein. In addition, the stock market in general, and the Nasdaq Global Market and the market for healthcare companies in particular, have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that, at times, have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the relevant companies. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted. A securities class action suit against us could result in substantial costs, potential liabilities and the diversion of management attention and resources. 21 Future sales or other dilution of our equity could depress the market price of our common shares. Sales of our common shares in the public market, or the perception that such sales could occur, could negatively impact the market price of our common shares. As of December 31, 2012 approximately 335 million of our common shares were issued, most of which are generally tradable in the public markets without restrictions; approximately 36 million of our common shares were issuable upon exercise of outstanding stock options under our various equity incentive plans at a weighted average exercise price of $1350; and we had approximately 0.3 million of our common shares underlying restricted stock units. We also have a number of institutional stockholders that own significant blocks of our common shares. If 1 or more of these stockholders were to sell large portions of their holdings in a relatively short time, for liquidity or other reasons, the prevailing market price of our common shares could be negatively affected. In addition, the issuance of additional common shares, or issuances of securities convertible into or exercisable for our common shares or other equity linked securities, including, convertible debt, preferred stock or warrants, could dilute the ownership interest of our common stockholders and could depress the market price of our common shares and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. We may need to seek additional capital. If this additional financing is obtained through the issuance of equity securities, debt convertible into equity or options or warrants to acquire equity securities, our existing stockholders could experience significant dilution upon the issuance, conversion or exercise of such securities. Our governing documents and rights plan may delay stockholder actions with respect to business combinations or the election of directors, or delay or prevent a sale of the company or changes in management. Our governing documents and our stockholder rights plan may have the effect of delaying stockholder actions with respect to business combinations or the election of directors, or delaying or preventing a sale of the company or a change in our management, including the following Our amended and restated bylaws require stockholders to give written notice of any proposal or director nomination to us within a specified period of time prior to any stockholder meeting and do not permit stockholders to call a special meeting of the stockholders, unless such stockholders hold at least 50% of our stock entitled to vote at the meeting. Our Board of Directors may approve the issuance, without further action by the stockholders, of our preferred shares, and fix the rights and preferences thereof. An issuance of preferred shares with dividend and liquidation rights senior to our common shares or convertible into a large number of our common shares could prevent a potential acquirer from gaining effective economic or voting control.
