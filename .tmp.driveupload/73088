For additional financial information concerning our operating performance, please refer to Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in I, Item 7 of this report and our Consolidated Financial Statements in I, Item 8 of this report. We pursue a market by market approach to the distribution of our implants, and establish strategic distribution arrangements in order to increase our penetration in selected markets. We have distribution arrangements with Medtronic, Inc. ( Medtronic ), Zimmer, Inc. ( Zimmer ), Blackst1 Medical, Inc., a subsidiary of Orthofix International NV ( Blackst1 ), Stryker Spine, a division of Stryker ( Stryker ), Aesculap Implant Systems, Inc. ( Aesculap ) and SeaSpine, Inc. ( SeaSpine ) for spine implants, and with Zimmer for our dental implants. For our surgical specialties markets, we distribute through Davol, Inc., a subsidiary of C. R. Bard, Inc. ( Davol ), for hernia repair, and breast reconstruction, through Coloplast A S of Denmark ( Coloplast ) for urology, through IOP, Inc. ( IOP ) for ophthalmology and through ENTrigue Surgical, Inc. ( ENTrigue ) for ENT applications. Zimmer, Stryker, Exactech, Inc., ( Exactech ) and Pi1er Surgical Technology, Inc. ( Pi1er ) are our current distributors for our allograft paste implants, and Wright Medical Technology, Inc. ( Wright ) distributes certain of our sports medicine implants. In the domestic sports medicine and general orthopedic applications we have developed a direct distribution force and a ne2rk of independent distributors. In the international market we use Zimmer for our dental implants, a direct distribution force in Germany, and a ne2rk of independent distributors outside Germany for other implants. As part of the tissue procurement process we rely on tissue recovery agencies to perform a risk assessment on every potential donor, interview family members and evaluate the donor medical records. Blood collected from each donor by the recovery agency is tested for the presence of viral or bacterial diseases. B1 tissue, soft tissue and tendon and ligament grafts are sterilized through our BioCleanse process and TUTOPLAST process only after they have passed this screening by the recovery agency and testing of the blood samples. Our BioCleanse process is a patented tissue sterilization process that is designed to add a measure of safety to our tissue implants and provide surgeons and patients with tissue implants that are free of spores, fungi, bacteria and viruses and is the only tissue sterilization process that has been reviewed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ). The BioCleanse process is an automated, multi step cleansing process which first removes blood and fats, then chemically sterilizes the tissue, while maintaining the structural integrity and biocompatibility of the tissue, and is applied to b1 tissue and tendon and ligament tissue. The TUTOPLAST process utilizes solvent dehydration and chemical inactivation, and is applied to 2 types of preserved allografts soft tissue, consisting of fascia lata, fascia temporalis, pericardium, dermis and sclera; and b1 tissue; consisting of various configurations of cancellous and cortical b1 material. We believe that the BioCleanse and TUTOPLAST processes are the industry leading sterilization processes. We are an accredited member of the American Association of Tissue Banks, or AATB, a nationally recognized association of the tissue banking industry. The accreditation covers the processing, storage and distribution of tissues for transplantation and research and informs users of our human tissue implants that we are in compliance with the minimum safety guidelines of the association. Corporate Information We were incorporated in 1997 in Florida as a wholly owned subsidiary of the University of Florida Tissue Bank, UFTB . We began operations on February 12, 1998 when UFTB contributed to us its allograft processing operations, related equipment and technologies, distribution arrangements, research and development activities and certain other assets. At the time of our initial public offering in August 2000, we reincorporated in the State of Delaware. On February 27, 2008, we completed our merger with Tutogen Medical, Inc., a Delaware corporation ( TMI ), in a tax free stock for stock exchange pursuant to which TMI shareholders received 122 shares of our common stock for each share of TMI common stock. In connection with the merger, we changed 2 Table of Contents our name from Regeneration Technologies, Inc. to RTI Biologics, Inc. The results of TMI operations have been included in our consolidated financial statements since the merger. Our principal offices are located at 11621 Research Circle, Alachua, Florida, and our ph1 number is (386) 418 8888. Industry Overview Defects in b1 and other human tissue can be caused by a variety of sources including trauma, congenital defect, aging, revision of joint replacements, infectious disease, cancer and other similar conditions. The prevalent method used to repair and promote the healing of defective tissue is surgical intervention, principally through the use of surgical implants. When considering a surgical procedure for tissue repair, surgeons and patients have a number of treatment options including metals and synthetics; xenograft tissue from an animal source; autograft tissue from the patient; and allograft tissue from another human donor. Metals and Synthetics Historically, the medical community has used metal and synthetic materials for implant procedures. Metal and synthetic technologies, however, have several shortcomings. 1 of the principal drawbacks to the use of these materials is that, despite best efforts, they do not facilitate the body natural tissue healing process known as remodeling. Metal exhibits different properties than b1, and 1 concern with its use in orthopedics is stress shielding, where the b1 adjoining the metal can become weak and fragile over time. This problem can be of particular concern to elderly patients who are more likely to suffer from osteoporosis. Additionally, a number of synthetics can wear away in the body, causing a negative immune system response. Other synthetics can chemically break down over time with negative biological and clinical consequences. Using metal and synthetic products may also make it difficult to do a second surgery or revision. Finally, some metal and synthetic products may need to be removed and or replaced, requiring the risk, expense and inconvenience of a second surgery. Xenograft Tissue Surgical procedures using xenograft tissue based implants are common in many areas of medicine including cardiac and vascular procedures, soft tissue repair and wound care. Xenograft based products are also used in the repair of b1 defects in orthopedic surgery as carriers for demineralized b1 matrix and b1 morphogenic protein products. The production of xenograft products involves recovering animal tissue, typically from cattle (bovine) or pigs (porcine), processing and sterilization, and then transplanting that recovered tissue into a human patient. Autograft and Allograft Tissue Surgeons are increasingly utilizing autograft and allograft tissue in their surgical procedures to take advantage of their natural healing characteristics. Autograft procedures involve a surgeon harvesting tissue from 1 part of a patient body for transplant to another part of the body. In contrast to autograft, allograft tissues are recovered from cadaveric donors, processed for certain intended uses and then transplanted by a surgeon into the patient body to make the needed repair. Autografts and allografts are not only osteoconductive, meaning they provide a scaffold for new b1 to attach itself to, but, in contrast to metals and some synthetics, can be osteoinductive as well, meaning they stimulate the growth of new tissue. 3 Table of Contents A significant drawback to autograft procedures is that they require an additional surgery to harvest the tissue from a second site in the patient body. Often in autograft procedures, the site where the patient tissue is harvested becomes painful and uncomfortable, and can take longer to heal than the primary surgical site. Additional complications can involve infection, nerve and arterial injury and joint instability. Moreover, a patient may not have sufficient quantities of quality autograft tissue for transplant procedures. We believe allograft is a superior surgical solution compared to autograft because the procedure involves only the primary surgical site. Marketing and Distribution Our lines of business are comprised primarily of the following markets sports medicine, spine, dental, surgical specialties, b1 graft substitutes, and general orthopedic. Our current implants range from allografts and xenografts that are precision machined for specific surgical applications to grafts conventionally processed for general surgical uses.

The most prevalent surgeries include repairs to the anterior cruciate ligament, or ACL in the knee, and rotator cuff, in the shoulder. Our principal sports medicine allografts are tendons for ligament reconstruction and our meniscal allografts for transplantation. Many of our sports medicine allografts utilize our patented pre shape technology and are shaped to fit surgeon requirements making them easier and or faster to implant. Our sports medicine products are marketed domestically through our direct biologics representatives and through our ne2rk of independent distributors and internationally through a ne2rk of independent distributors. On February 9, 2007, we entered into a Xenograft Distribution and Supply Agreement with Wright. Under this contract, Wright distributes certain allografts, Sterling xenografts as well as xenografts designed by Wright which we process and package. This agreement was expanded to include additional designs effective March 9, 2007. During 2007 we enhanced the sports medicine product category by introducing the following new products BioCleanse Meniscus, B1 Tendon B1 Select, BioCleanse Per1us Longus and Sterling Xenograft Wedge. In May 2008, our first fresh stored osteochondral (OC) allograft for cartilage repair was successfully implanted. In 2009, we introduced our Matrix HD dermis products for wound repair in addition to our Fresh OC Talus products, an extension of the fresh osteochondral line. 5 Table of Contents Spine The spine market for allografts includes precision machined implants and b1 paste utilized in spinal procedures. Our spine allografts are marketed domestically through our non exclusive relationships with Medtronic, Blackst1, Zimmer, Stryker, Aesculap and SeaSpine. Medtronic is our principal distributor in the spine market. We originally entered into an Exclusive Distribution and License Agreement with Medtronic, dated June 1, 2002, pursuant to which Medtronic distributed specialty allograft and b1 paste for use in spinal surgery. We have amended our agreement with Medtronic several times. Our current agreement with Medtronic expires June 1, 2014. During September 2000, Zimmer began distributing TMI b1 products under a ten year agreement for applications in the spine market. In April 2003, TMI entered into an exclusive license and distribution agreement with Zimmer. Effective with that agreement, Zimmer became a stocking distributor . Currently, Zimmer distributes both traditional b1 and specialty allografts, and b1 paste for use in spinal surgery. Our current spine agreement with Zimmer expires March 8, 2011 and renews automatically for successive 1 year terms. On November 21, 2006, we entered into an Allograft Distribution and Supply Agreement with Blackst1 for an initial term of 3 years with additional 1 year renewals unless terminated in writing by either party. Under this agreement, we process and package implants designed by Blackst1 for distribution by Blackst1 On November 17, 2007, this agreement was expanded to include four additional implant designs. On June 6, 2007, we entered into an Allograft Distribution and Supply Agreement with an initial term of 3 years and 1 year automatic renewals with Stryker, under which we process and package implants designed by Stryker for distribution by Stryker. The current agreement with Stryker expires June 5, 2011 and renews automatically for successive 1 year terms. On December 15, 2008, we entered into an Implant Development and Supply Agreement with an initial term of 10 years with Aesculap, under which we will process and package implants designed by Aesculap for distribution by Aesculap. On July 29, 2010, we entered into a Contract Processing and Supply Agreement with an initial term of 3 years with SeaSpine, under which we will process and package implants designed by SeaSpine for distribution by SeaSpine. Dental We currently provide various products including cancellous and cortical b1 and human and bovine membranes primarily for dental procedures related to augmenting ridge restoration. During September 2000, Zimmer entered into a ten year agreement to represent TUTOPLAST processed b1, under the brand name Puros , for dental applications. Zimmer marketed the implants to the end user and in the United States we shipped and billed the customer directly. Distribution fees earned pursuant to the agreement were recognized ratably over the term of the agreement. During 2006, TMI expanded its relationship with Zimmer by adding pericardium and dermis soft tissue implants for dental applications. The additions of these implants provided Zimmer with a full line of biologic implants for the dental surgeons. In August 2007, TMI entered into an agreement to extend Zimmer exclusivity internationally into Europe, the Middle East and Asia. The international agreement includes both human and bovine b1 and soft tissue implants and allows Zimmer to provide the dentist with a complete product offering for the regenerative procedure. On September 3, 2010, we entered into a new exclusive distribution agreement (the Agreement ), with Zimmer Dental Inc. ( Zimmer ), a subsidiary of Zimmer, Inc., with an effective date of September 30, 2010. The Agreement has an initial term of ten years. Under the terms of the Agreement, we will supply sterilized allograft and xenograft implants (the 6 Table of Contents Implants ) at an agreed upon transfer price, and Zimmer will be the exclusive distributor of the Implants for dental and oral applications worldwide (except the Ukraine), subject to certain Company obligations under an existing distribution agreement with a third party with respect to certain implants for the dental market. In consideration for Zimmer exclusive distribution rights, Zimmer agreed to the following 1) payment to us of $130 million within ten days of the effective date (the Upfront Payment ), 2) annual exclusivity fees ( Annual Exclusivity Fees ) paid annually for the term of the contract to be paid at the beginning of each calendar year, the first of which was paid on January 18, 2011 in the amount of $4.0 million (the Initial Annual Exclusivity Fee ), and , 3) escalating annual purchase minimums to maintain exclusivity. Upon occurrence of an event that materially and adversely affects Zimmer ability to distribute the Implants, Zimmer may be entitled to certain refund rights with respect to the Upfront Payment and the then current Annual Exclusivity Fee, where such refund would be in an amount limited by a formula specified in the Agreement that is based substantially on the number of days from the occurrence of such event to the date that it is cured by us to the satisfaction of Zimmer. Both the Upfront Payment and the Initial Annual Exclusivity Fee have been deferred and are being recognized as other revenues based on Zimmer anticipated annual purchases over the term of the agreement. Surgical Specialties We distribute implants for surgical specialties which include hernia, breast reconstruction, urology, ophthalmology, and ENT. In January 2006, TMI entered into a four year exclusive worldwide distribution agreement with Davol Inc., a subsidiary of C.R. Bard, Inc. ( Davol ), to promote, market and distribute TMI line of allograft biologic tissues for hernia repair and the reconstruction of the chest and abdominal walls. Under the agreement, Davol paid TMI $33 million in fees for the exclusive distribution rights. On July 13, 2009, we and Davol amended their January 2006 distribution agreement with TMI. Under the amended agreement, 1) Davol paid us $8.0 million in non refundable fees for exclusive distribution rights for the distribution to the breast reconstruction market until July 13, 2019, 2) the exclusive worldwide distribution agreement related to the hernia market was extended to July 13, 2019, and 3) Davol agreed to pay us certain additional exclusive distribution rights fees contingent upon the achievement of certain revenue milest1s by Davol during the duration of the contract. In the fourth quarter of 2010, Davol paid us the first revenue milest1 payment of $35 million. The $8.0 million and $35 million exclusivity payments have been deferred and are being recognized as other revenue on a straight line basis over ten years, the initial term of the contract, and the remaining term of the contract, respectively. In June 2006, TMI signed a distribution agreement with Mentor Corporation ( Mentor ) for the exclusive North American rights for the use of TUTOPLAST dermis for breast reconstruction. Under the agreement, Mentor paid TMI $500,000 in fees for the exclusive distribution rights. Mentor initiated distribution during the third quarter of 2007. Johnson & Johnson completed its acquisition of Mentor in January 2009 and the agreement with Mentor expired in June 2009. For urological indications, TMI partnered with Mentor since 1998. During 2006, Mentor sold their urology business to Coloplast and assigned the TMI agreement to Coloplast. In May 2007, TMI signed an agreement with Coloplast extending the current distribution agreement and expanding its scope both internationally, and to include TMI Tutoplast processed bovine pericardium. As a stocking distributor, Coloplast markets TUTOPLAST fascia lata, dermis, and pericardium tissue grafts. IOP has been a distributor of TMI since 1998, and is the exclusive distributor for TUTOPLAST processed tissue for ophthalmic applications. In December 2008, we entered into a biologics development, distribution and supply agreement with ENTrigue to develop, promote, distribute and supply our line of allograft biologic tissues for the ear, nose and throat market. Initial shipments of implants to ENTrigue began in 2009. 7 Table of Contents BGS and general orthopedic Allograft Paste. Surgeons principally use our allograft paste implants, which are composed of demineralized b1 matrix ( DBM ) and in some cases a biologic gel carrier, in fracture treatment, b1 and joint reconstruction and periodontal applications, such as ridge augmentation for dental implants. Our allograft paste implants are marketed under Osteofil by Medtronic, Puros RTU Paste by Zimmer and the Optefil , Opteform , Regenafil and Regenaform brands with Exactech and we distribute directly the BioSet family of paste products through our direct distributor force, Pi1er, and our international distribution ne2rk. Our DBM Boat products are marketed under AlloCraft by Stryker. We also distribute these products through Medtronic, Exactech, Zimmer, Stryker, Pi1er, our own direct distribution force and an international distribution ne2rk. We pay Exactech a 3% royalty fee with respect to our moldable allograft pastes distributed by others which is the same formulation as the Exactech product. The agreement is for an initial term expiring June 30, 2014, subject to earlier termination under certain limited circumstances. In 2007, we entered into an exclusive distribution agreement with Zimmer with an initial term of 10 years, relating to new b1 paste products. The field of use for these products includes all orthopedic, trauma, reconstruction, spine, sports medicine, dental and oral maxillofacial applications. As part of the agreement, Zimmer has made payments to us totaling $5.0 million for the aforementi1d exclusive distribution rights, and has to maintain certain minimum order volumes beginning in 2010. The $5.0 million exclusivity payment is being recognized as other revenue on a straight line basis over the initial term of the contract. The contract provides for repayment, on a pro rata basis, of the exclusivity payments during the initial contract term for specific events of non performance, as defined in the agreement. The agreement also includes automatic 2 year renewal terms, as well as buy out provisions by both parties upon proper notice of cancellation. Milled Allograft and Xenograft. Our b1 graft substitutes business also includes certain types of blended and milled b1 allografts and xenografts, such as our demineralized b1 matrix, cortical cancellous chips and ground cancellous chips, used in total hip and knee replacements and for various injuries. Conventional Allografts. Our conventional allograft business includes a wide variety of allograft categories including our intercalary grafts, such as our frozen femoral heads which are used for cancer treatment procedures and hip and knee reconstruction. We also produce various types of fashi1d b1, such as strips and shafts used for various orthopedic procedures. The BioCleanse Tissue Sterilization Solution We have developed and utilized in the United States the patented BioCleanse tissue sterilization process, which is an automated, pharmaceutical grade chemical sterilization process for musculoskeletal b1 and certain soft tissue. This process is fully validated to kill or inactivate all classes of conventional pathogens, viruses, microbes, bacteria and fungi. Our BioCleanse process is able to remove greater than 99% of the blood, fats, lipids and other unwanted materials from the tissue we process. We believe the removal of blood, fat, lipids and other unwanted materials results in faster patient healing because it eliminates the need for the patient body to remove these substances using natural processes following surgery. An important element of the BioCleanse process is that while it removes unwanted materials embedded within the tissue, it maintains the tissue structural integrity and compression strength. Studies have shown that tissue sterilized with BioCleanse maintains the same compression strength as untreated tissue and has significantly greater compression strength than tissue treated with other sterilization processes. The BioCleanse process has been reviewed by the FDA which concluded that BioCleanse was a validated tissue sterilization process demonstrated to prevent contamination and cross contamination of tissue grafts. The significance of the review is that we are not aware of any other tissue sterilization process related to human tissue in our industry that has been reviewed or approved by the FDA. The FDA does not have a formal approval process in place for tissue related processing techniques. 8 Table of Contents Our BioCleanse process is currently used on most of our b1 allografts and xenografts and most of our musculoskeletal soft tissue products. In addition to the safety advantage of BioCleanse , it provides us with a number of significant research and development opportunities, including the ability to introduce b1 growth factors and anti bacterial, anti viral and cancer fighting agents into our implants. The TUTOPLAST Tissue Sterilization Solution The TUTOPLAST tissue sterilization process utilizes solvent dehydration and chemical inactivation to remove blood, lipids and extraneous materials, inactivate viruses and prions, and break down RNA and DNA into fragments not capable of replication and disease transmission while preserving the biological and mechanical properties. We apply the TUTOPLAST process to 2 types of preserved allografts soft tissue, consisting of fascia lata, fascia temporalis, pericardium, dermis and sclera; and b1 tissue; consisting of various configurations of cancellous and cortical b1 material. Processed pericardium, fascia lata and dermis are collagenous tissue used to repair, replace or line native connective tissue primarily in dental, ophthalmology, urology, plastic and reconstructive surgeries. Dermis is also used in hernia repair and pelvic floor reconstruction. Sclera is used in ophthalmology procedures such as, anterior and posterior segment patch grafting applications for glaucoma, retina and trauma surgery and oculoplastics, as well as contour wrapping of an orbital implant. Processed cortical and cancellous b1 material is used in a wide variety of applications in spine, orthopaedic and dental surgeries. Tissue Recovery Tissue recovery is the actual removal of tissue from a donor after receiving appropriate consent. Consent is obtained by the tissue recovery group. We operate certain tissue recovery groups directly, and contract with other independent FDA registered tissue recovery groups which specialize in this activity. Tissue recovery personnel aseptically recover musculoskeletal tissue within 24 hours following a donor death, using surgical instruments and sterile techniques similar to those used in hospitals for routine surgery. Recovered tissue is placed on wet or dry ice and then transported by the donor recovery agency to the tissue processor or possibly a research institution. Under U.S. law, human tissue cannot be sold. However, the law permits the recovery of some costs, such as those involved in recovering, processing and storing tissue and costs related to the advancement of tissue processing technologies, all types of activities in which we are involved. Our ne2rk of donor recovery groups recovers a variety of tissue types from donors including the fibula, femur, tibia, humerus, ilium, pericardium, fascia lata, dermis, sclera, tendons and ligaments. Once we receive tissue that has been screened at our tissue recovery centers, we re screen this recovered material to guard against transmittable diseases. This screening process includes evaluation of risk on the basis of donor medical history, lifestyle, interviews with the donor family and physical examination of the donor. We also perform biomedical testing and culturing at various stages during the processing of tissue, using FDA licensed tests and other tests for known viruses and pathogens. We have relationships with over thirty tissue donor recovery agencies across the country. We also have relationships outside the United States. Our largest single donor recovery group represented 12% of our total donor tissue for the year ended December 31, 2010. We believe additional recovery group relationships would be available if needed and consequently that the loss of any 1 of our sources of donor tissue would not have a material impact on our operating results. We continue to develop new xenograft tissue implants. Implants processed from xenograft tissue are regulated by the FDA as devices and require approval or licenses from the FDA prior to marketing in the United States. The sources of our animal tissues are regulated closed herds. The herds are located in the United States 9 Table of Contents and New Zealand. Our clinical studies indicate that our xenograft implants, after processing through BioCleanse and TUTOPLAST are equivalent to our allograft implants with respect to functionality, safety and incorporation. We believe the continued development of our xenograft implants will help us meet unmet demand for certain allografts and also allow us to develop new biological implants that cannot currently be made due to structural limitations of human tissue. Research and Development Our research and development costs for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 were $9,435, $8,899 and $8,143, respectively. In 2010, we continued to increase our investment in our R&D efforts by funding new projects including research and development projects at our facility in Neunkirchen, Germany. Our scientists are focusing their studies on delivering optimal regenerative medicine solutions through allograft and xenograft, as well as expanding the uses of the BioCleanse and Tutoplast processing technologies. We plan to continue to develop new implants and technologies within our current market, and to develop additional tissue related technologies for other markets. We plan to do this by building on our core technology platforms BioCleanse , TUTOPLAST , precision machining, assembled grafts, and tissue and mediated osteoinduction, We operate a dedicated research team working on advanced technologies, and have embedded development technical teams who work with the business marketing teams focused on expanding the scope and scale of existing competencies such as tissue sterilization and tissue machining to meet specific surgical needs. This approach has resulted in the development of core science platforms, a pipeline of concepts for development and marketing and focused development to meet immediate needs. In 2010 we launched 15 new implants in sports medicine, spine, surgical specialties and BGS and general orthopedic developed by our research and development teams. Intellectual Property Our business depends upon the significant know how and proprietary technology we have developed. To protect this know how and proprietary technology, we rely on a combination of trade secret laws, patents, licenses, trademarks and confidentiality agreements. The effect of these intellectual property rights is to define z1s of exclusive use of the covered intellectual property. Our United States patent holdings include patents relating to or covering BioCleanse , our proprietary method of cleaning, sterilizing and virally inactivating donor tissue; our MD Series cortical b1 dowel; soft and calcified tissue implants; certain precision machined allograft intervertebral spacers and other spinal implants; matrix compositions comprised of gelatin, muscle or pulverized dermis; the use of the interference screw technology; our segmentally demineralized graft; methods and instruments for improved meniscus transplantation; materials and methods for improved b1 tendon b1 transplantation; and various assembled b1 tendon b1 implant designs. Our foreign patent holdings include our MD Series cortical b1 dowel technology, our precision machined spinal implants, and our BioCleanse process. The duration of patent rights generally is 20 years from the date of filing of priority application, while trademarks, once registered, are essentially perpetual. We also have patent applications pending in the U.S. (including continuation and divisional applications), and corresponding foreign patent applications pending in various countries including, but not limited to, Canada, Japan, Australia and the European Union. We have also entered into exclusive and non exclusive licenses relating to a wide array of third party technologies. In addition, we rely on our substantial body of know how, including proprietary tissue recovery techniques and processes, research and development, tissue processing and quality assurance. The TUTOPLAST process utilizes proprietary trade secrets. No significant patents are expected to expire in the next five years. 10 Table of Contents Competition Competition in the tissue reconstruction and healing industry is intense and subject to rapid technological change and evolving industry requirements and standards. Companies within the industry compete on the basis of design of related instrumentation, efficacy of products, relationships with the surgical community, depth of range of implants, scientific and clinical results, and pricing. Allograft and our xenograft implants compete with autograft, metals and synthetic tissues. Our principal competitors in the conventional allograft market include the Musculoskeletal Transplant Foundation, or MTF, AlloSource, LifeCell, Inc., a subsidiary of Kinetic Concepts Inc. and LifeNet. Among our competitors in precision machined allograft are MTF, LifeNet and AlloSource. Other companies who process and distribute allograft pastes include Medtronic, AlloSource, Integra, Wright, and MTF. Companies who process and distribute xenograft tissue include Synovis, LifeCell, Cook Surgical and Medtronic. Government Regulation Government regulation plays a significant role in the processing and distribution of allografts. We procure, process and market our tissue products worldwide. Although some standards of harmonization exist, each country in which we do business has its own specific regulatory requirements. These requirements are dynamic in nature and, as such, are continually changing. New regulations may be promulgated at any time and with limited notice. While we believe that we are in compliance with all existing pertinent international and domestic laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that changes in governmental administrations and regulations will not adversely affect our operations. Failure to comply with applicable requirements could result in fines, injunctions, civil penalties, recall or seizure of products, suspension of production, inability to market current products, criminal prosecution, and or refusal of the government to authorize the marketing of new products. In the United States, our allograft products are regulated by the FDA under Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Parts 1270 and 1271, Current Good Tissue Practice for Human Cell, Tissue, and Cellular and Tissue Based Products . Xenograft tissues and allograft b1 paste are regulated as medical devices and subject to FDA 21 CFR, Part 820 (Current Good Manufacturing Practices for Medical Devices) and related statutes from the FDA. In addition, our U.S. operation is subject to certain state and local regulations, as well as compliance to the standards of the tissue bank industry accrediting organization, the AATB. In Germany, allografts are classified as drugs and the German government regulates such products in accordance with German Drug Law. On April 7, 2004, the European Commission issued a human tissue directive to regulate allografts within the European Union ( EU ). Our Neunkirchen facility is presently licensed by the German Health Authorities and in compliance with applicable international laws and regulations, allowing us to market our human and animal implant products globally. The FDA and international regulatory bodies conduct periodic compliance inspections of both our U.S. and our German processing facilities. Both operations are registered with the U.S. FDA Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research ( CBER ) and are certified to ISO 134852003 The Alachua facility is also accredited by the AATB and is licensed in the states of Florida, New York, California, Maryland, Delaware and Illinois. The Neunkirchen facility is registered with the German Health Authority ( BfArM ) as a pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturer and is subject to German drug law. We believe that worldwide regulation of allografts and xenografts is likely to intensify as the international regulatory community focuses on the growing demand for these implant products and the attendant safety and efficacy issues of citizen recipients. We currently market and distribute allografts that are subject to the FDA Human Tissue Intended for Transplantation and Subparts A and B of Human Cells, Tissues, and Cellular and Tissue Based Products regulations. Under these regulations, we are required to perform donor screening and infectious disease testing and to document this screening and testing for each donor from whom we process tissue. The FDA has authority 11 Table of Contents under the rules to inspect human tissue processing facilities, and to detain, recall, or destroy tissues for which appropriate documentation is not available. We are not required to obtain pre market approval or clearance from the FDA for allografts that meet the regulation definition of human tissue. The FDA may regulate certain allografts as medical devices, drugs, or biologics, which would require that we obtain approval or product licensure from the FDA. This would occur in those cases where the allograft is deemed to have been more than minimally manipulated or indicated for non homologous use. In general, homologous use occurs when tissue is used for the same basic function that it fulfilled in the donor. The definitional criteria for making these determinations appear in the FDA rules. If the FDA decides that certain of our current or future allografts are more than minimally manipulated or indicated for non homologous use, it would require licensure, approval or clearances of those allografts. Allografts requiring such approval are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA. We would be required to list these allografts as a drug, as a medical device, or as a biologic, and to manufacture them in specifically registered or licensed facilities in accordance with FDA regulation Current Good Manufacturing Practices. We would also be subject to post marketing surveillance and reporting requirements. In addition, our manufacturing facilities and processes would be subject to periodic inspection to assess compliance with Current Good Manufacturing Practices. Our labeling and promotional activities would be subject to scrutiny by the FDA and, in certain instances, by the Federal Trade Commission. The export of drugs, devices and biologics is also subject to more intensive regulation than is the case for human tissue products. Certain of our allograft pastes are subject to regulation as medical devices under the 510(k) pre market notification process because they incorporate a non human gelatin constituent as a carrier. We have received FDA clearance for our flowable and moldable allograft paste implants for orthopedic and spinal applications and for our allograft b1 paste for dental applications. Our xenograft implants are regulated by the FDA as medical devices and are subject to pre market approval or clearance by the FDA. Our xenograft implants are CE marked and are therefore subject to a design examination review by a Notified Body. In 2006, the RTI US facility received initial CE mark approval for ten different product models, followed by additional product approvals in subsequent years. In addition, the US facility received A Certificate of Suitability from the European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines & HealthCare (EDQM) for bovine b1 in 2008. This certifies that the bovine b1 material complies with the European Pharmacopoeia monograph for products at risk for transmission of animal spongiform disease. The FDA requires tissue processors to register with the agency and list their tissue products. We are currently an FDA registered tissue processor. Our tissue processing generates by products classified as medical hazardous waste by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the Florida Department of Environmental Protection. All such by products must be segregated and properly disposed of in compliance with applicable environmental regulations. We believe that we are in compliance with the applicable regulations. Environmental Our allografts and xenografts, as well as the chemicals used in processing, are handled and disposed of in accordance with country specific, federal, state and local regulations. We contract with independent, third parties to perform all gamma terminal sterilization of our allografts. In view of the engagement of a third party to perform irradiation services, the requirements for compliance with radiation hazardous waste does not apply, and therefore we do not anticipate that having any material adverse effect upon our capital expenditures, results of operations or financial condition. However, we are responsible for assuring that the service is being performed in accordance with applicable regulations. 12 Table of Contents Employees As of December 31, 2010, we had a total of 711 employees of whom 154 were employed in Germany and of whom 5 were employed in France. Management believes its relations with its employees are good.

Item 1A. RISK FACTORS An investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should consider each of the risks and uncertainties described in this section and all of the other information in this document before deciding to invest in our common stock. Any of the risk factors we describe below could severely harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. The market price of our common stock could decline if any of these risks or uncertainties develop into actual events. You may lose all or part of the m1y you pay to buy our common stock. We depend heavily upon sources of human tissue, and any failure to obtain tissue from these sources in a timely manner will interfere with our ability to process and distribute allografts. The supply of human tissue has at times limited our growth, and may not be sufficient to meet our future needs. In addition, due to seasonal changes in mortality rates, some scarce tissues that we currently use for allografts are at times in particularly short supply. Other factors, some of which are unpredictable, such as negative publicity and regulatory actions in the industry in which we operate also could unexpectedly reduce the available supply of tissue. We rely on donor recovery groups for their human tissue supplies and we have relationships with over thirty tissue donor recovery agencies across the country. We also have relationships outside the United States. Donor 14 Table of Contents recovery groups are part of relatively complex relationships. They provide support to donor families, are regulated by the FDA, and are often affiliated with hospitals, universities or organ procurement organizations. Our relationships with donor recovery groups, which are critical to our supply of tissue, could be affected by relationships recovery groups have with other organizations. Any negative impact of the regulatory and disease transmission issues facing the industry, as well as the negative publicity that these issues create, could adversely affect our ability to negotiate contracts with recovery groups. We cannot be sure that the supply of human tissue will continue to be available at current levels or will be sufficient to meet our needs. If we are not able to obtain tissue from current sources sufficient to meet our needs, we may not be able to locate additional replacement sources of tissue on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Any interruption of our business caused by the need to locate additional sources of tissue would significantly impact our revenues. We expect that our revenues would decline in proportion to any decline in tissue supply. If we fail to maintain existing strategic relationships or are unable to identify distributors of our implants, revenues may decrease. We currently derive the majority of our revenues through our relationships with Medtronic, Zimmer, Davol and Exactech. In addition, Medtronic and Zimmer provide nearly all of the instrumentation, surgeon training, distribution assistance and marketing materials for the lines of spinal allografts they distribute. Variations in the timing and volume of orders by Medtronic and Zimmer may have a material effect upon our revenues. If our relationships with Medtronic or Zimmer are terminated or reduced for any reason and we are unable to replace these relationships with other means of distribution, we would suffer a material decrease in revenues. We may need to obtain the assistance of additional distributors to market and distribute our new allografts and technologies, as well as to market and distribute our existing allografts and technologies to new markets or geographical areas. We may not be able to find additional distributors who will agree to and successfully market and distribute our allografts and technologies on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. If we are unable to establish additional distribution relationships on favorable terms, our revenues may decline. If adverse macro economic conditions persist, our business and revenues could be adversely affected. We have been adversely affected by the current macro economic conditions. If this slowdown continues or worsens, it could have a material adverse effect upon our business and revenues. If third party payors fail to provide appropriate levels of reimbursement for the use of our implants, revenues could be adversely affected. Political, economic and regulatory influences are subjecting the healthcare industry in the United States to fundamental change. In March 2010, President Obama signed the Affordable Care Act into law. The new law will result in sweeping changes across the health care industry. The primary goal of this comprehensive legislation is to extend health coverage to approximately 32 million uninsured legal U.S. residents through a combination of public program expansion and private sector health insurance reforms. To fund the expansion of insurance coverage, the legislation contains measures designed to promote quality and cost efficiency in health care delivery and to generate budgetary savings in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. We are unable to predict the full impact of the Affordable Care Act at this time due to the law complexity and current lack of implementing regulations or interpretive guidance. However, we expect that several provisions of the Affordable Care Act will have a material effect on our business. Our revenues will largely depend on the reimbursement of patients medical expenses by government health care programs and private health insurers. Governments and private insurers closely examine medical procedures 15 Table of Contents incorporating new technologies to determine whether the procedures will be covered by payment, and if so, the level of payment which may apply. We cannot be sure that third party payors will continue to reimburse for our implants at the current levels. If we fail to maintain the high processing standards that implants require or if we are unable to develop processing capacity as required, our commercial opportunity will be reduced or eliminated. Implants require careful calibration and precise, high quality processing. Achieving precision and quality control will require skill and diligence by our personnel. If we fail to achieve and maintain these high processing standards, including avoiding processing errors, design defects or comp1nt failures; we would be forced to recall, withdraw or suspend distribution of our implants; our implants and technologies could fail quality assurance and performance tests; production and deliveries of our implants could be delayed or cancelled; and our processing costs could increase. Further, to be successful, we will need to manage our human tissue processing capacity related to tissue recovery and demand for our allografts. It may be difficult for us to match our processing capacity to demand due to problems related to yields, quality control and assurance, tissue availability, adequacy of control policies and procedures, and lack of skilled personnel. If we are unable to process and produce our implants on a timely basis, at acceptable quality and costs, and in sufficient quantities, or if we experience unanticipated technological problems or delays in processing, it will reduce revenues and increase our cost per allograft processed. Our allograft and xenograft implants and technologies could become subject to significantly greater regulation which could disrupt our business. The FDA and several states have statutory authority to regulate allograft processing, including our BioCleanse and TUTOPLAST processes, and allograft based materials. The FDA could identify deficiencies in future inspections of our facilities or our suppliers or promulgate future regulatory rulings that could disrupt our business, reducing profitability. If any of our allografts fall under the FDA definitions of more than minimally manipulated or indicated for non homologous use, we would be required to obtain medical device approval or clearance or biologics licenses, which could require clinical testing and could result in disapproval of our license applications and restricted distribution of any of our allografts which may become subject to pre market approval. The FDA could require post market testing and surveillance to monitor the effects of such allografts, could restrict the commercial applications of these allografts, and could conduct periodic inspections of our facilities and our suppliers. Delays encountered during the FDA approval process could shorten the patent protection period during which we have the exclusive right to commercialize such technologies or could allow others to come to market before us with similar technologies. FDA regulations of human cellular and tissue based products, titled Good Tissue Practices, cover all stages of allograft processing, from procurement of tissue to distribution of final allografts. These regulations increased regulatory scrutiny within the industry in which we operate and have lead to increased enforcement action which affects the conduct of our business. In addition, these regulations have a significant effect upon recovery agencies which supply us with tissue and increase the cost of recovery activities. Any such increase would translate into increased costs, as we would expect to reimburse the recovery agencies based on their cost of recovery. Other regulatory entities include state agencies with statutes covering tissue banking. Regulations issued by Florida, New York, California and Maryland will be particularly relevant to our business. Most states do not currently have tissue banking regulations. However, recent incidents of allograft related infections in the industry may stimulate the development of regulation in other states. It is possible that others may make allegations against us or against donor recovery groups or tissue banks, including those with which we have relationships, 16 Table of Contents about non compliance with applicable FDA regulations or other relevant statutes and regulations. Allegations like these could cause regulators or other authorities to take investigative or other action, or could cause negative publicity for our business and the industry in which we operate. Some of our implants contain tissue derived from animals, commonly referred to as xenografts. Xenograft implants are medical devices that are subject to pre market approval or clearance by the FDA. We have received FDA clearance on several xenograft implants. However, we may not receive FDA approval or clearance to market new implants as we attempt to expand the quantity of xenograft implants available for distribution. The allograft industry is subject to additional local, state, federal and international government regulations and any increased regulations of our activities could significantly increase the cost of doing business, thereby reducing profitability. Some aspects of our business are subject to additional local, state, federal or international regulation. Changes in the laws or new interpretations of existing laws could negatively affect our business, revenues or prospects, and increase the costs associated with conducting our business. In particular, the procurement and transplantation of allograft tissue is subject to federal regulation under the National Organ Transplant Act, or NOTA, a criminal statute that prohibits the purchase and sale of human organs, including b1 and other tissue. NOTA permits the payment of reasonable fees associated with the transportation, processing, preservation, quality control and storage of human tissue. If NOTA were amended or interpreted in a way that made us unable to include some of these costs in the amounts we charge our customers, it could reduce our revenues and therefore hurt our business. It is possible that more restrictive interpretations or expansions of NOTA could be adopted which could require us to change 1 or more aspects of our business, at a substantial cost, in order to continue to comply with this statute. A variety of additional local, state, federal and international government laws and regulations govern our business, including those relating to the storage, handling, generation, manufacture and disposal of medical wastes from the processing of tissue. If we fail to conduct our business in compliance with these laws and regulations, we could be subject to significant liabilities for which our insurance may not be adequate. Moreover, such insurance may not always be available in the future on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. If our insurance proves to be inadequate to pay a damage award, we may not have sufficient funds to do so, which would harm our financial condition and liquidity. Our success depends on the continued acceptance of our allograft and xenograft implants and technologies by the medical community. New allograft and xenograft implants, technologies or enhancements to our existing implants may never achieve broad market acceptance, which can be affected by numerous factors, including lack of clinical acceptance of implants and technologies; introduction of competitive tissue repair treatment options which render implants and technologies too expensive or obsolete; lack of availability of third party reimbursement; and difficulty training surgeons in the use of tissue implants and technologies. Market acceptance will also depend on our ability to demonstrate that our existing and new implants and technologies are an attractive alternative to existing tissue repair treatment options. Our ability to do so will depend on surgeons evaluations of the clinical safety, efficacy, ease of use, reliability and cost effectiveness of these tissue repair options and technologies. For example, we believe that some in the medical community have lingering concerns over the risk of disease transmission through the use of allografts. Furthermore, we believe that even if the medical community generally accepts our implants and technologies, recommendations and endorsements by influential surgeons will be important to their broad commercial success. If our implants and technologies are not broadly accepted in the marketplace, we may not achieve a competitive position in the market. 17 Table of Contents Rapid technological changes could result in reduced demand for our products. Technologies change rapidly in the industry in which we operate. For example, steady improvements have been made in synthetic human tissue substitutes which compete with our tissue implants. Unlike allografts, synthetic tissue technologies are not dependent on the availability of tissue. If 1 of our competitors successfully introduces synthetic technologies using recombinant technologies, which stimulate the growth of tissue surrounding an implant, it could result in a decline in demand for tissue implants. We may not be able to respond effectively to technological changes and emerging industry standards, or to successfully identify, develop or support new technologies or enhancements to existing implants in a timely and cost effective manner, if at all. If we are unable to achieve the improvements in our implants necessary for their successful commercialization, the demand for our implants will suffer. We face intense competition, which could result in reduced acceptance and demand for our implants and technologies. The medical technology biotechnology industry is intensely competitive. We compete with companies in the United States and internationally that engage in the development and production of medical technologies and processes including biotechnology, orthopedic, pharmaceutical, biomaterial and other companies; academic and scientific institutions; and public and private research organizations. Many of our competitors have much greater financial, technical, research, marketing, distribution, service and other resources than ours. Moreover, our competitors may offer a broader array of tissue repair treatment products and technologies or may have greater name recognition in the marketplace. For example, we compete with a number of divisions of Johnson & Johnson, a company with significantly greater resources and brand recognition than ours. Our competitors, including several development stage companies, may develop or market technologies that are more effective or commercially attractive than our technologies, or that may render our technologies obsolete. For example, the development of a synthetic tissue product that permits remodeling of b1s could reduce the demand for allograft and xenograft based products and technologies. If we do not manage the medical release of donor tissue into processing in an effective and efficient manner, it could adversely affect profitability. Many factors affect the level and timing of donor medical releases, including the effectiveness of donor screening currently performed by our donor recovery groups, the timely receipt, recording and review of required medical documentation, and employee loss and turnover in our medical records department. We can provide no assurance that releases will occur at levels which maximize our processing efficiency and minimize our cost per allograft processed. Negative publicity concerning methods of human tissue recovery and screening of donor tissue in the industry in which we operate may reduce demand for our allografts and impact the supply of available donor tissue. Media reports or other negative publicity concerning both improper methods of tissue recovery from donors and disease transmission from donated tissue may limit widespread acceptance of our allografts. Unfavorable reports of improper or illegal tissue recovery practices, both in the United States and internationally, as well as incidents of improperly processed tissue leading to transmission of disease, may broadly affect the rate of future tissue donation and market acceptance of allograft technologies. Potential patients may not be able to distinguish our allografts, technologies and the tissue recovery and the processing procedures from those of our competitors or others engaged in tissue recovery. In addition, families of potential donors may become reluctant to agree to donate tissue to for profit tissue processors. 18 Table of Contents If our patents and the other means we use to protect our intellectual property prove to be inadequate, our competitors could exploit our intellectual property to compete more effectively against us. The law of patents and trade secrets is constantly evolving and often involves complex legal and factual questions. The U.S. government may deny or significantly reduce the coverage we seek for our patent applications before or after a patent is issued. We cannot be sure that any particular patent for which we apply will be issued, that the scope of the patent protection will be comprehensive enough to provide adequate protection from competing technologies, that interference proceedings regarding any of our patent applications will not be filed, or that we will achieve any other competitive advantage from a patent. In addition, it is possible that 1 or more of our patents will be held invalid if challenged or that others will claim rights in or ownership of our patents and other proprietary rights. If any of these events occur, our competitors may be able to use our intellectual property to compete more effectively against us. Because patent applications are secret until patents are actually issued (or until 18 months after a patent application has been filed) and the publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature lags behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain that our patent application was the first application filed covering a particular invention. If another party rights to an invention are superior to ours, we may not be able to obtain a license to use that party invention on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. In addition, our competitors, many of which have greater resources than ours, could obtain patents that will prevent, limit or interfere with our ability to make use of our inventions either in the United States or in international markets. Further, the laws of some foreign countries do not always protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Litigation or regulatory proceedings in the United States or foreign countries also may be necessary to enforce our patent or other intellectual property rights or to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of our competitors. These proceedings can be costly, result in development delays, and divert the attention of our management. We rely upon unpatented proprietary techniques and processes in tissue recovery, research and development, tissue processing and quality assurance. It is possible that others will independently develop technology similar to our technology or otherwise gain access to or disclose our proprietary technologies. We may not be able to meaningfully protect our rights in these proprietary technologies, which would reduce our ability to compete. Our success depends in part on our ability to operate without infringing on or misappropriating the proprietary rights of others, and if we are unable to do so we may be liable for damages. We cannot be certain that U.S. or foreign patents or patent applications of other companies do not exist or will not be issued that would prevent us from commercializing our allografts and technologies. Third parties may sue us for infringing or misappropriating their patent or other intellectual property rights. Intellectual property litigation is costly. If we do not prevail in litigation, in addition to any damages we might have to pay, we could be required to stop the infringing activity or obtain a license requiring us to make royalty payments. It is possible that a required license will not be available to us on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. In addition, a required license may be non exclusive, and therefore our competitors may have access to the same technology licensed to us. If we fail to obtain a required license or are unable to design around another company patent, we may be unable to make use of some of the affected technologies or distribute the affected allografts, which would reduce our revenues. The defense costs and settlements for patent infringement lawsuits are not covered by insurance. Patent infringement lawsuits can take years to settle. If we are not successful in our defenses or are not successful in obtaining dismissals of any such lawsuit, legal fees or settlement costs could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. 19 Table of Contents We or our competitors may be exposed to product or professional liability claims which could cause us to be liable for damages or cause investors to think we will be liable for similar claims in the future. The development of allografts and technologies for human tissue repair and treatment entails an inherent risk of product or professional liability claims, and substantial product or professional liability claims may be asserted against us. We are party to a number of legal proceedings relating to product or professional liability. The implantation of donated human tissue implants creates the potential for transmission of communicable diseases. Although we comply with Federal and state regulations and guidelines intended to prevent communicable disease transmission, and our tissue suppliers are also required to comply with such regulations, there can be no assurances that (i) our tissue suppliers will comply with such regulations intended to prevent communicable disease transmissions; (ii) even if such compliance is achieved, that our implants have not been or will not be associated with transmission of disease; or (iii) a patient otherwise infected with disease would not err1ously assert a claim that the use of our implants resulted in disease transmission. We currently have $20 million of product and professional liability insurance to cover claims. This amount of insurance may not be adequate for potential claims if we are not successful in our defenses. Moreover, insurance covering our business may not always be available in the future on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. If our insurance proves to be inadequate to pay a damage award, we may not have sufficient funds to do so, which would harm our financial condition and liquidity. In addition, successful product liability claims made against 1 of our competitors could cause claims to be made against us or expose us to a perception that we are vulnerable to similar claims. Claims against us, regardless of their merit or potential outcome, may also hurt our ability to obtain surgeon endorsement of our allografts or to expand our business. If we are not successful in expanding our distribution activities into international markets, we will not be able to pursue 1 of our strategies for increasing revenues. Our international distribution strategies vary by market, as well as within each country in which we operate. For example, we distribute only a portion of our line of allograft and xenograft products within each country. Our international operations will be subject to a number of risks which may vary from the risks we face in the United States, including the need to obtain regulatory approvals in additional foreign countries before we can offer our implants and technologies for use; longer distribution to collection cycles, as well as difficulty in collecting accounts receivable; dependence on local distributors; limited protection of intellectual property rights; fluctuations in the values of foreign currencies; and political and economic instability. The outcome of litigation or arbitration in which we are involved is unpredictable and an adverse decision in any such matter could adversely impact our business, financial condition or results of operations. We are from time to time subject to legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. For example, we are currently involved in an arbitration brought by Medtronic Sofamor Danek, USA, Inc. ( MSD ), a subsidiary of Medtronic, related to events stemming from the actions of Biomedical Tissue Services, Ltd. ( BTS ), an unaffiliated company recovery agency, and the subsequent voluntary recall of allografts processed by us from tissue originating from BTS. MSD seeks indemnification from us for its legal fees, costs and expenses allegedly incurred during the defense of cases brought by recipients of these allografts. Any material litigation or arbitration, even if without merit, inevitably results in the diversion of the attention of our management and other relevant personnel. To the extent uninsured, such claims further require the expenditure of our resources for defense costs for us and for parties to whom we may have indemnification obligations. We also may be required to pay material amounts in settlement costs or damages. No assurances can be given that the results of the current arbitration or any new legal matters will be favorable to us. An adverse resolution of lawsuits or arbitrations could adversely impact our business, financial condition or results of operations. 20 Table of Contents Item 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS.
