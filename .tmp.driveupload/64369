ITEM 1 BUSINESS I PART tbreak of an illness or other health issue could significantly disrupt our operations. The current COVID 19 pandemic and the response to it have had, and we expect they will continue to have, an adverse effect on our business, operations, and future results. A widespread ou If we are unable to obtain and maintain patent protection for our products and technology, or if the scope of the patent protection obtained is not sufficiently broad, our competitors could develop and commercialize products and technology similar or identical to ours, and our ability to successfully commercialize our products and technology may be adversely affected. Our gene therapy approach utilizes vectors derived from viruses, which may be perceived as unsafe or may result in unforeseen adverse events. Negative public opinion and increased regulatory scrutiny of gene therapy may damage public perception of the safety of our product candidates and adversely affect our ability to conduct our business or obtain regulatory approvals for our product candidates. Gene therapies and their companion diagnostics are novel, complex and difficult to manufacture. We could experience manufacturing problems that result in delays in the development or commercialization of our product candidates or otherwise harm our business. We face significant competition in an environment of rapid technological change and the possibility that our competitors may achieve regulatory approval before us or develop therapies that are more advanced or effective than ours, which may harm our business and financial condition, and our ability to successfully market or commercialize our product candidates. Our product candidates or the process for administering our product candidates may cause undesirable side effects or have other properties that could delay or prevent their regulatory approval, limit their commercial potential or result in significant negative consequences following any potential marketing approval. We may encounter substantial delays or difficulties in commencement, enrollment or completion of our preclinical studies or clinical trials, or may fail to demonstrate safety and efficacy to the satisfaction of applicable regulatory authorities, which could prevent us from commercializing our current and future product candidates on a timely basis, if at all. Regulatory requirements governing gene and cell therapy products have changed frequently and may continue to change in the future. Such requirements may lengthen the regulatory review process, require us to modify current studies or perform additional studies or increase our development costs, which in turn may force us to delay, limit, or terminate certain of our programs. Table of Contents 4 Our AAV gene therapy product candidates are based on a novel technology, which makes it difficult and potentially infeasible to predict the duration and cost of development of, and of subsequently obtaining regulatory approval for, our product candidates. To date, all of our revenue has been derived from our collaborations with Sanofi Genzyme Corporation, AbbVie Biotechnology Ltd., AbbVie Ireland Unlimited Company and Neurocrine Biosciences, Inc. If any ongoing or future collaboration agreements were to be terminated, our business financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be harmed. We will need to raise additional funding, which may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. Failure to obtain this necessary capital when needed may force us to delay, limit or terminate certain of our product development efforts or other operations. We have incurred significant losses in every year prior to 2020 and anticipate that we will incur losses for the foreseeable future and may never achieve or maintain consistent profitability. We may not be able to generate sufficient revenue from the commercialization of our product candidates and may never be consistently profitable. Investment in our securities involves risk and uncertainties that you should be aware of when evaluating our business. The following is a summary of what we believe to be the principal risks facing our business, as more fully described under , Item 1A Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K.
