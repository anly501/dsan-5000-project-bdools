ITEM 1 BUSINESS Company Overview Haem1tics is a global healthcare company dedicated to providing a suite of innovative medical products and solutions for customers, to help them improve patient care and reduce the cost of healthcare. Our technology addresses important medical markets blood and plasma comp1nt collection, the surgical suite and hospital transfusion services. When used in this report, the terms we, us, our and the Company mean Haem1tics. Blood is essential to a modern healthcare system. Blood and its comp1nts (plasma, red cells and platelets) have many vital and frequently life saving clinical applications. Plasma is used for patients with major blood loss and is manufactured into biopharmaceuticals to treat a variety of illnesses, including immune diseases and coagulation disorders. Red cells treat trauma patients or patients undergoing surgery with high blood loss, such as open heart surgery or organ transplant. Platelets have many uses in patient care, including supporting cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. We view our operations and manage our business in 3 principal reporting segments Plasma, Blood Center and Hospital. For that purpose, Plasma includes plasma collection devices and disposables, plasma donor management software, and anticoagulant and saline sold to plasma customers. Blood Center includes blood collection and processing devices and disposables for red cells, platelets and whole blood. Hospital , which is comprised of Hemostasis Management, Cell Salvage, Transfusion Management and Vascular Closure products, includes devices and methodologies for measuring coagulation characteristics of blood, surgical blood salvage systems, specialized blood cell processing systems and disposables, blood transfusion management software and vascular closure devices. Financial information concerning these segments is provided in Note 18 to our audited consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. We believe that Plasma and Hospital have growth potential, while Blood Center competes in challenging markets that require us to manage the business differently, including reducing costs, shrinking the scope of the current product line, and evaluating opportunities to exit unfavorable customer contracts. Market and Products Product Lines The following describes our principal products in each of our segments. Plasma Our Plasma business offers automated plasma collection and donor management software systems that improve the yield, efficiency, quality, safety and overall donor experience at plasma collection centers. We continue to invest in technology that lowers the overall cost to collect plasma while maintaining high standards of quality and safety. Plasma Collection Market for Fractionation Human plasma is collected for 2 purposes. First, it is used for transfusions in patients, such as trauma victims who need to compensate for extreme blood loss, and second, it is processed into pharmaceuticals that aid in the treatment of immune diseases and coagulation disorders. Plasma for transfusion is almost exclusively collected by blood centers as part of their broader mission to supply blood comp1nts. Plasma that is fractionated and manufactured into pharmaceuticals frequently referred to as source plasma is mainly collected by vertically integrated biopharmaceutical companies who operate their own collection centers and recruit donors specifically for source plasma donation. The markets for transfusion plasma and source plasma have different participants, product requirements and growth profiles. We serve the market for plasma that is processed into pharmaceuticals through our Plasma business, and we serve the market for transfusion plasma through our Blood Center business. 1 of the distinguishing features of the source plasma market is the method of collection. There are 3 primary ways to collect plasma. The first is to collect it from whole blood donations. When whole blood is processed, plasma can be separated at the same time as red cells and platelets and stored for future use. The second is as part of an apheresis procedure that also collects another blood comp1nt. These 2 methods are mainly used by blood centers to collect plasma for transfusions. The third method is a dedicated apheresis procedure that only collects plasma and returns the other blood comp1nts to the donor. This third method is mainly used for source plasma collection. 1 Table of Contents Our Plasma business unit focuses on the collection of source plasma by pharmaceutical manufacturers using apheresis devices that only collect plasma and software solutions that support the efficient operation of dedicated source plasma collection centers. Our Blood Center business supports the collection of plasma for blood collectors, such as the American Red Cross, using both whole blood and multi comp1nt apheresis collection devices. Over the last 20 years, the collection of source plasma has increasingly been d1 by vertically integrated biopharmaceutical companies such as CSL Limited (together with its affiliates, CSL ), Grifols S.A. (together with its affiliates, Grifols ), Octapharma AG and Takeda's BioLife Plasma subsidiary. With their global operations and management expertise, these companies are focused on efficient plasma supply chain management and leveraging information technology to manage operations from the point of plasma donation through fractionation to the production of the final product. Demand for source plasma has continued to grow because of an expanding end user market for plasma derived biopharmaceuticals. In particular, therapies that require a significant quantity of plasma to create have fueled an increase in the number of donations and dedicated source plasma collection centers. A significant portion of this growth has occurred in the United States with U.S. produced plasma now meeting an increasing percentage of plasma volume demand worldwide. The U.S. has regulations that are significantly more favorable relative to other markets for plasma collectors. The frequency with which a donor may donate, the volume of plasma that may be donated each time and the ability to remunerate donors are all optimal in the U.S., leading to over 70% of worldwide source plasma collections occurring in the U.S. Plasma collectors have long sought changes to plasma collection regulations outside of the U.S. to allow for greater frequency, volume per donation, and remuneration but achievements have been limited and no changes are foreseen in the prevalence of U.S. collections. Plasma Products Built around our automated plasma collection devices, related disposables, and software, our portfolio of products and services is designed to support multiple facets of plasma collector operations. We have a long standing commitment to understanding our customers' collection and manufacturing processes. As a result, we aim to design equipment that is durable, dependable, and easy to use and to provide comprehensive training and support to our plasma collection customers. Today, nearly all source plasma collections worldwide are performed using automated collection technology at dedicated facilities. We offer multiple products to support these dedicated source plasma operations, including our NexSys PCS and PCS2 plasmapheresis equipment, related disposables and intravenous solutions. We also offer a portfolio of integrated information technology platforms for plasma customers to manage their donors, operations and supply chain. Our software products, including our latest NexLynk DMS donor management system, automate the donor interview and qualification process, streamline the workflow process in the plasma center, provide the controls necessary to evaluate donor suitability, determine the ability to release units collected and manage unit distribution. With our software solutions, plasma collectors can manage processes across the plasma supply chain, ensure quality and compliance business process support, react quickly to business changes and implement opportunities to reduce costs. With our PCS brand, we have provided an automated platform dedicated to the collection of plasma for over 20 years. In fiscal 2018, we received U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) 510(k) clearance for our next generation device, the NexSys PCS and CE mark clearance of the NexSys PCS device in the European Union, or EU, and Australia, subject to additional local requirements. NexSys PCS is designed to enable higher plasma yield collections, improve productivity in our customers centers, enhance the overall donor experience and provide safe and reliable collections that will become life changing medicines for patients. NexSys PCS includes bi directional connectivity to the NexLynk DMS donor management system to improve operational efficiency within plasma centers, through automated programming of donation procedures and automated data capture of procedure data. The NexSys PCS capabilities enable collections with higher plasma yields. Our YES TM technology is a yield enhancing solution that enables increases in plasma yield per collection by an additional 18 26 mL per donation, on average. In fiscal 2021, we received FDA 510(k) clearance for our NexSys PCS with Persona technology. NexSys PCS with Persona technology uses a percent plasma nomogram that customizes plasma collection based on an individual donor's body composition. The new, proprietary Persona technology strengthens the NexSys PCS value 2 Table of Contents proposition and reinforces our commitment to supporting the plasma industry. We expect to pursue further regulatory clearances for additional enhancements to the overall product offering. We have entered into long term commercial contracts and are continuing the rollout and support of NexSys PCS devices and NexLynk DMS donor management software for these Plasma customers. Our Plasma business unit represented 38.2%, 46.4% and 44.1% of our total revenue in fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Blood Center Our Blood Center business offers a range of solutions that improve donor collection centers' ability to acquire blood, filter blood and separate blood comp1nts. We continue to look for solutions to improve donor safety and control costs through the existing product portfolio. Our products and technologies help donor collection centers optimize blood collection capabilities and donor processing management. Blood Center Market There are millions of blood donations throughout the world every year that produce blood products for transfusion to surgical, trauma, or chronically ill patients. Patients typically receive only the blood comp1nts necessary to treat a particular clinical condition. Platelet therapy is frequently used to alleviate the effects of chemotherapy and to help patients with bleeding disorders. Red cells are often transfused to patients to replace blood lost during surgery and transfused to patients with blood disorders, such as sickle cell anemia or aplastic anemia. Plasma, in addition to its role in creating life saving pharmaceuticals, is frequently transfused to replace blood volume in trauma victims and surgical patients. When collecting blood comp1nts there are 2 primary collection methods, manual whole blood donations and automated comp1nt blood collections. While most donations are manual whole blood, the benefit of automated comp1nt blood collections is the ability to collect more than 1 unit of the targeted blood comp1nt. Manual whole blood donations are collected from the donor and then transported to a laboratory where the blood is separated into its comp1nts. Automated comp1nt blood collections separate the blood comp1nt real time while a person is donating blood. In this method, only the specific target blood comp1nt is collected and the remaining comp1nts are returned to the blood donor. While overall we expect total demand for blood to remain stable to slightly declining, demand in individual markets can vary greatly. The development in mature markets of more minimally invasive procedures with lower associated blood loss, as well as hospitals' improved blood management techniques and protocols have more than offset the increasing demand for blood from aging populations. Emerging markets are seeing demand growth with expanded healthcare coverage and greater access to more advanced medical treatments. Blood Center Products We offer automated blood comp1nt and manual whole blood collection systems to blood collection centers to collect blood products efficiently and cost effectively. We market the MCS brand apheresis equipment which is designed to collect specific blood comp1nts from the donor. Utilizing the MCS automated platelet collection protocols, blood centers collect 1 or more therapeutic doses of platelets during a single donation. Our portfolio of disposable whole blood collection and comp1nt storage sets offer flexibility in collecting a unit of whole blood and the subsequent production and storage of blood comp1nts, including options for in line or dockable filters for leukoreduction. Our Blood Center business unit represented 35.3%, 321% and 34.1% of our total revenue in fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Hospital Hospitals are called upon to provide the highest standard of patient care while at the same time reduce operating costs. Haem1tics' Hospital business has four product lines which include Hemostasis Management, Cell Salvage, Transfusion Management and Vascular Closure. Vascular Closure became a product line during fiscal 2021 as a result of the March 2021 acquisition of Cardiva Medical, Inc. ( Cardiva ), a market leader in vascular closure devices. Each product line has a leading market position and a mission of helping hospitals and clinicians provide the highest standard of patient care while at the same time reducing operating and procedural costs and helping decision makers in hospitals optimize blood acquisition, storage and usage in critical settings. 3 Table of Contents Hemostasis Management Hemostasis Management Market Hemostasis refers to a patient's ability to form and maintain blood clots. The clinical management of hemostasis requires that physicians have the most complete information to make decisions on how to best maintain a patient coagulation equilibrium between hemorrhage (bleeding) and thrombosis (clotting). Hemostasis is a critical challenge in various medical procedures, including cardiovascular surgery, organ transplantation, trauma, post partum hemorrhage and percutaneous coronary intervention. By understanding a patient hemostasis status, clinicians can better plan for the patient care pathway. For example, they may decide whether to start or discontinue the use of certain drugs or determine the need for a transfusion and which specific blood comp1nts would be most effective in minimizing blood loss and reducing clotting risk. Such planning supports better care, which can lead to lower hospital costs through a reduction in unnecessary blood product transfusions, reduced adverse transfusion reactions and shorter intensive care unit and hospital stays. Hemostasis Management Products Our portfolio of hemostasis diagnostic systems enables clinicians to assess holistically the coagulation status of a patient at the point of care or laboratory setting. We have four viscoelastic testing systems that we market to hospitals and laboratories as an alternative to routine blood tests the TEG 5000 hemostasis analyzer system, the TEG 6s hemostasis analyzer system, the ClotPro hemostasis analyzer system, and the HAS 100 hemostasis analyzer system. While the TEG and HAS platforms utilize thromboelastography and the ClotPro system utilizes thromboelastometry, all of the platforms provide a method of testing the efficiency of blood coagulation using whole blood samples. Each hemostasis diagnostic system consists of an analyzer that is used with single use reagents and disposables. In addition, TEG Manager software connects multiple TEG 5000 and TEG 6S analyzers throughout the hospital, providing clinicians with remote access to both active and historical test results that inform treatment decisions. The TEG 5000 system is approved for a broad set of indications in all of our markets. The TEG 6s system is approved for the same set of indications as the TEG 5000 in Europe, Australia and Japan. We continue to pursue a broader set of indications for TEG 6s in the U.S. During fiscal 2020, we received FDA clearance for the use of TEG 6s in adult trauma settings. This clearance builds on the current indication for the TEG 6s system in cardiovascular surgery and cardiology procedures, making it the first cartridge based system available in the U.S. to evaluate the hemostasis condition in adult trauma patients. The ClotPro system received CE mark clearance in March 2019 and is currently available in select European and Asia Pacific markets. The HAS 100 device is currently commercialized in China. Cell Salvage Cell Salvage Market The Cell Salvage market is mainly comprised of devices designed to transfuse back a patient own blood during or after surgery. Loss of blood is common in many surgical procedures, including open heart, trauma, transplant, vascular and orthopedic procedures, and the need for transfusion of oxygen carrying red cells to make up for lost blood volume is routine. Patients commonly receive donor (or allogeneic) blood which carries various risks for transfusion reactions including chills, fevers or other side effects that can prolong a patient recovery. An alternative to allogeneic blood is surgical cell salvage, also known as autotransfusion, which reduces or eliminates a patient need for blood donated from others and ensures that the patient receives the freshest and safest blood possible his or her own. Surgical cell salvage involves the collection of a patient own blood during or after surgery for reinfusion of red cells to that patient. Blood is sucti1d from the surgical site or collected from a wound or chest drain, processed and washed through a centrifuge based system that yields concentrated red cells available for transfusion back to the patient. This process occurs in a sterile, closed circuit, single use consumable set that is fitted into an electromechanical device. We market our surgical blood salvage products to surgical specialists, primarily cardiovascular, orthopedic and trauma surgeons, and to anesthesiologists and surgical suite service providers. Cell Salvage Products Our Cell Saver Elite + autologous blood recovery system is a surgical blood salvage system targeted to medium to high blood loss procedures, such as cardiovascular, orthopedic, trauma, transplant, vascular, obstetrical and gynecological surgeries. The Cell Saver Elite + is designed to minimize allogeneic blood use and reliably recover and transfuse a patient own high quality blood. 4 Table of Contents Transfusion Management Transfusion Management Market Hospital transfusion services professionals and clinicians are facing cost restraints in addition to the pressure to enhance patient safety, compliance and operational efficiency. Managing the safety and traceability of the blood supply chain and comprehensive management of patients, orders, specimens, blood products, derivatives and accessories across the hospital ne2rk is challenging. In addition, providing clinicians with the vital access to blood when needed most while maintaining traceability is a key priority. Frequently when blood products leave the blood bank, the transfusion management staff loses control and visibility of the blood comp1nts. They often do not know if the blood was handled, stored or transfused properly, which may lead to negative effects on patient safety, product quality, inventory availability and staff efficiency as well as increased waste. Transfusion Management Products Our Transfusion Management solutions are designed to help provide safety, traceability and compliance from the hospital blood bank to the patient bedside and enable consistent care across the hospital ne2rk. Our SafeTrace Tx transfusion management software is considered the system of record for all hospital blood bank and transfusion service information. BloodTrack blood management software is a modular suite of blood management and bedside transfusion solutions that combines software with hardware comp1nts and acts as an extension of the hospital blood bank information system. The software is designed to work with blood storage devices, including the BloodTrack HaemoBank . Vascular Closure Vascular Closure Market Catheter based, minimally invasive alternatives to open surgery have transformed cardiovascular medicine. The majority of these procedures gain access to the vascular system through the femoral artery or vein. These access sites in the vessel require closure post procedure. Even with the major advances in technology over the last 40 years, the most common complications in coronary and peripheral procedures are still related to the access site. Manual compression, the traditional standard of care, involves the application of pressure in order to facilitate the formation of a blood clot at the access site. Vascular closure devices improve upon manual compression by rapidly closing the access site and facilitating more efficient workflow. Vascular Closure Products The VASCADE technology platform was developed to address the limitations of manual compression and existing vascular closure devices. Our VASCADE family of products consists of 2 devices, VASCADE and VASCADE MVP , which share a common, innovative technology that features a simple, catheter based delivery system and leverages the natural clot inducing properties of collagen. This novel design significantly reduces access site complications, increases patient satisfaction and improves hospital workflow metrics that, in turn, drive economic benefits and cost savings. Our Vascular Closure devices address the growing number of catheter based coronary, peripheral and electrophysiology procedures that require vascular access site closure each year. Designed around an easy to use, catheter based delivery system and the natural clot inducing properties of collagen, our VASCADE product is the only marketed vascular closure device clinically proven to both increase workflow efficiency and reduce access site complications relative to manual compression for coronary and peripheral procedures. Similarly, our VASCADE MVP device is the only marketed vascular closure device clinically proven and labeled to improve workflow relative to manual compression for electrophysiology procedures. Importantly, these improvements drive meaningful cost savings for hospitals, ambulatory surgery centers, and other treatment facilities. Our Hospital business unit represented 24.2%, 19.6% and 19.9% of our total revenue in fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Marketing Sales Distribution We market and sell our products to biopharmaceutical companies, blood collection groups and independent blood centers, hospitals and hospital service providers, group purchasing organizations and national health organizations through our own direct sales force (including full time sales representatives and clinical specialists) as well as independent distributors. Sales representatives target the primary decision makers within each of those organizations. Research and Development Our research and development centers in the U.S. ensure that protocol variations are incorporated to closely match local customer requirements. In addition, Haem1tics maintains software development operations in Canada. 5 Table of Contents Customer collaborations are also an important part of our technical strength and competitive advantage. These collaborations with customers and transfusion experts provide us with ideas for new products and applications, enhanced protocols and potential test sites as well as objective evaluations and expert opinions regarding technical and performance issues. The development of blood comp1nt separation products, hemostasis analyzers and software has required us to maintain technical expertise in various engineering disciplines, including mechanical, electrical, software, biomedical engineering and chemistry. Innovations resulting from these various engineering efforts enable us to develop systems that are faster, smaller and more user friendly, or that incorporate additional features important to our customer base. In fiscal 2021, research and development resources were allocated to support innovation across our product portfolio. In October 2020, we announced FDA clearance for our NexSys PCS with Persona technology. In April 2020, we also announced the commercial availability of the next generation of SafeTrace Tx Transfusion Management Software in the United Kingdom. This software version features significant improvements to the user experience and workflow efficiency. Additionally, we have continued to make investments related to our next generation plasma collection and software systems, the European Medical Device Regulation, our Hemostasis Management produce line, and our recent product acquisitions in Hospital. Manufacturing We endeavor to supply products that are both high quality and cost competitive for our customers by leveraging continuous improvement methodologies, focusing on our core competencies and partnering with strategic suppliers that complement our capabilities. In general, we design our equipment and consumables and use contract manufacturers to build the devices, while the majority of consumables are manufactured by us. Our production activities occur in controlled settings or clean room environments and have built in quality checks throughout the manufacturing processes. Our manufacturing teams are focused on continuously improving our productivity, product cost and product quality through change control procedures, validations and strong supplier management programs. We regularly review our logistics capabilities, inventory and safety stock levels and maintain business continuity plans to address supply disruptions that may occur. Our primary consumable manufacturing operations are located in North America and Malaysia. Contract manufacturers also supply comp1nt sets and liquid solutions according to our specifications and manufacture in Mexico, Japan, Singapore, Thailand and the Philippines. Our capital equipment is principally manufactured in Malaysia, Australia and the U.S. Plastics and other petroleum based products are the principal comp1nt of our disposable products and can be affected by oil and gas prices. Contracts with our suppliers help to mitigate some of the short term effects of price volatility in this market. However, increases in the price of petroleum derivatives could result in corresponding increases in our costs to procure plastic raw materials. Intellectual Property We consider our intellectual property rights to be important to our business. We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, as well as provisions in our agreements with third parties, to protect our intellectual property rights. We hold numerous patents in the United States and have applied for numerous additional U.S. patents relating to our products and related technologies. We also own or have applied for corresponding patents in selected foreign countries. These patents cover certain elements of our products and processes, including protocols employed in our equipment and aspects of certain of our disposables. Our patents may cover current products, products in markets we plan to enter, or products in markets we plan to license to others. Certain patents may also be defensive in that they are directed to technologies not currently embodied in our current products. We also license patent rights from third parties that cover technologies that we use or plan to use in our business. We own various trademarks that have been registered in the United States and certain other countries. Our policy is to obtain patent and trademark rights in the U.S. and foreign countries where such rights are available and we believe it is commercially advantageous to do so. However, the standards for international protection of intellectual property vary widely. We cannot assure that pending patent and trademark applications will result in issued patents and registered 6 Table of Contents trademarks, that patents issued to or licensed by us will not be challenged or circumvented by competitors, or that our patents will not be determined invalid. To maintain our competitive position, we also rely on the technical expertise and know how of our personnel. We believe that unpatented know how and trade secrets relied upon in connection with our business and products are generally as important as patent protection in establishing and maintaining a competitive advantage. Competition To remain competitive, we must continue to develop and acquire new cost effective products, information technology platforms and business services. We believe that our ability to maintain a competitive advantage will continue to depend on a combination of factors. Some factors are largely within our control such as (i) maintenance of a positive reputation among our customers, (ii) development of new products that meet our customer's needs, (iii) obtaining regulatory approvals for our products in key markets, (iv) obtaining patents that protect our innovations, (v) development and protection of proprietary know how in important technological areas, (vi) product quality, safety and cost effectiveness and (vii) continual and rigorous documentation of clinical performance. Other factors are outside of our control. We could see changes in regulatory standards or clinical practice that favor a competitor's technology or reduce revenues in key areas of our business. Our technical staff is highly skilled, but certain competitors have substantially greater financial resources and larger technical staff at their disposal. There can be no assurance that competitors will not direct substantial efforts and resources toward the development and marketing of products competitive with those of Haem1tics. In addition, we face competition from several large, global companies with product offerings similar to ours. Terumo Blood and Cell Technologies ( Terumo BCT ) and Fresenius SE & Co. KGaA, in particular, have significantly greater financial and other resources than we do and are strong competitors in a number of our businesses. The following provides an overview of the key competitors in each of our 3 global product enterprises. Plasma In the automated plasma collection market, we principally compete with Fresenius' Fenwal Aurora and Aurora Xi product lines on the basis of speed, plasma yield per donation, quality, reliability, ease of use, services and technical features of the collection systems and on the long term cost effectiveness of equipment and disposables. In China, the market is populated by local producers of a product that is intended to be similar to ours. Recently, those competitors have expanded to markets beyond China, including European and South American countries. In the field of plasma related software, MAK Systems is the primary competitor along with applications developed internally by our customers. In April 2021, Terumo BCT and CSL announced a collaboration to deliver a new plasma collection platform for CSL's U.S. collection centers. This potential new entrant to the market is undergoing a clinical trial and will require FDA device clearance prior to use in the U.S. Blood Center Most donations worldwide are traditional manual whole blood collections and approximately 30% of the Blood Center portfolio competes in this space. We face intense competition in our whole blood business on the basis of quality and price. Our main competitors are Fresenius, MacoPharma and Terumo BCT. Our MCS automated comp1nt blood collections, which represents approximately 60% of the Blood Center portfolio, not only compete against the traditional manual whole blood collection market (particularly in red cells) but also compete with products from Terumo BCT and Fresenius. Technology is the key differentiator in automated comp1nt blood collections, as measured by the time to collect more than 1 unit of a specific targeted blood comp1nt. While not all donors are eligible to donate more than 1 unit, it continues to become more prevalent in markets with a significant number of eligible donors. Therefore, both Haem1tics and our competitors continue to experience downward pressure on collection through single platelet collection procedures. 7 Table of Contents Hospital Hemostasis Management Our hemostasis analyzer systems are used primarily in surgical applications. Competition includes routine coagulation tests, such as prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time and platelet count marketed by various manufacturers, such as Instrumentation Laboratory, Diagnostica Stago SAS and Sysmex. The TEG analyzer competes with these routine laboratory tests based on its ability to provide a more complete picture of a patient's hemostasis at a single point in time and to measure the clinically relevant platelet function for an individual patient. In addition, TEG and ClotPro systems compete more directly with other viscoelastic testing systems, including ROTEM analyzers, the VerifyNow System and HemoSonics Quantra . ROTEM and VerifyNow instruments are marketed by Instrumentation Laboratory, a subsidiary of Werfen. HemoSonics is owned and offered by Diagnostica Stago. There are also additional technologies being explored to assess viscoelasticity and other characteristics that can provide insights into the coagulation status of a patient. In the advanced viscoelastic testing segment, Haem1tics is the global market leader. Cell Salvage In the intraoperative autotransfusion market, competition is based on reliability, ease of use, service, support and price. For high volume platforms, each manufacturer's technology is similar and our Cell Saver technology competes principally with products offered by LivaNova PLC, Medtronic and Fresenius. Transfusion Management SafeTrace Tx and BloodTrack compete in the transfusion management software market within the broader category of hospital information systems. SafeTrace Tx is an FDA regulated blood bank information system ( BBIS ) that integrates and communicates with other healthcare information systems such as the electronic health record and laboratory information system within the hospital. The BloodTrack software, also FDA regulated, is an extension of the BBIS and provides secure, traceable blood units at the point of care, including trauma, surgery, outpatient and critical care settings. Growth drivers for these markets include patient safety, operational efficiencies and compliance. SafeTrace Tx competition primarily consists of stand al1 BBIS including WellSky and some electronic health record software that includes a built in transfusion management solution including Cerner. Global competition for BloodTrack varies by country including MSoft in Europe and established blood practices in the U.S. such as using standard refrigerators and manual movement of blood products. BloodTrack integrates with the hospital existing lab or blood bank system allowing for greater market acceptance. Vascular Closure The vascular closure industry is highly competitive and has been evolving rapidly with the introduction of new products, technologies, regulations and activities of industry participants. Our VASCADE family of products serves as an alternative to existing methods of femoral vascular access site closure in interventional procedures, including manual compression and other femoral access closure devices. Our main competitors in femoral access closure for coronary and peripheral procedures include Terumo BCT, Abbott Laboratories and Cardinal Health. There are not currently any competing vascular access site closure devices that are labeled for electrophysiology procedures that require multiple access sites. We compete primarily on the basis that our products are optimized for the requirements of coronary, peripheral and electrophysiology procedures, including procedures that require multiple access sites. In addition, our value proposition is supported by robust clinical trial evidence and study data, which demonstrate reduced access site complication rates as well as workflow improvements compared to manual compression that lead to cost savings. 8 Table of Contents Significant Customers In fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, our ten largest customers accounted for approximately 49%, 54% and 52% of our net revenues, respectively. 2 of our Plasma customers, CSL and Grifols, each were greater than 10% of total net revenues and in total accounted for approximately 23%, 27% and 27% of our net revenues in fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. In addition, a third customer accounted for greater than 10% of the Plasma segment's net revenues, but did not exceed 10% of total net revenues in fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019. 1 customer accounted for greater than 10% of our Blood Center segment net revenues, but did not exceed 10% of total net revenues in fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019. Government Regulation Due to the variety of products that we manufacture, we and our products are subject to a wide variety of regulations from numerous government agencies, including the FDA, and similar agencies outside the U.S. To varying degrees, each of these agencies requires us to comply with laws and regulations governing the development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, marketing and distribution of our products. In the United States, medical devices, drugs, and biological products are subject to extensive regulation by FDA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and other federal and state statutes and regulations. The failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to clear or approve applications, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties and criminal prosecution. Medical Device Regulation Premarket Requirements U.S. Unless an exemption applies, all medical devices introduced to the U.S. market are required by the FDA, as a condition of marketing, to secure clearance of a 510(k) premarket notification, grant of a request for de novo classification, or approval of a premarket approval application, or PMA. The FDA classifies medical devices into 1 of 3 classes based on risk. Devices deemed to pose a low or moderate risk are placed in Class I or II. Manufacturers of most Class II devices, and a few Class I devices, must submit to the FDA a 510(k) premarket notification requesting clearance for commercial distribution. Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk or devices deemed not substantially equivalent to a previously cleared 510(k) device are placed in class III, requiring submission and approval of a PMA or risk based classification through the de novo process. To obtain 510(k) clearance, we must submit a premarket notification demonstrating that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to a previously 510(k) cleared device or a device that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976 for which the FDA has not yet called for the submission of PMAs, or a device that has been the subject of a de novo classification. The FDA 510(k) clearance pathway usually takes from 3 to 12 months from the date the notification is submitted, but it can take longer, depending on the extent of the FDA's requests for additional information and the amount of time a sponsor takes to fulfill them. We may need to first obtain an investigational device exemption (for significant risk devices), known as an IDE, in order to conduct extensive clinical testing of the device to obtain the necessary clinical data for submission to the FDA. After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, will require a new 510(k) clearance or could require premarket approval. A device that cannot demonstrate substantial equivalence to a previously marketed predicate is automatically deemed Class III. The de novo process provides a pathway to classify novel medical devices for which general controls al1, or general and special controls, provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness for the intended use, but for which there is no legally marketed predicate device. Once a request for de novo classification is granted by the FDA, the newly classified device may be used as a predicate by the applicant or a competitor in a future 510(k) notification submission, if the FDA determines that new devices of the same type require 510(k) clearance. Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk are placed in Class III. A PMA is required for most Class III devices. The PMA process is generally more detailed, lengthier and more expensive than the 510(k) and de novo processes. Prior to the acquisition of Cardiva in March 2021, we had not been required to obtain a PMA for any of our products and did not have any Class III products in our product pipeline. With the acquisition of Cardiva, we have acquired VASCADE and VASCADE 9 Table of Contents MVP, which are both Class III products for which PMAs were previously obtained. The 510(k) clearance, de novo classification, and PMA processes can be resource intensive, expensive, lengthy and require payment of significant user fees. Postmarket Requirements U.S. After the FDA permits a device to enter commercial distribution, numerous regulatory requirements continue to apply. Generally, establishments that design and or manufacture devices are required to register with the FDA. They also must provide the FDA with a list of the devices that they design and or manufacture at their facilities. Other postmarket requirements include compliance with The Quality System Regulation, or QSR, which sets forth current good manufacturing practice, or CGMP, requirements for medical devices. The QSR applies to manufacturers, including contract manufacturers, of finished medical devices, and governs methods, facilities, and controls used in designing, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, storing, installing and servicing such devices. Among other requirements, manufacturers of medical devices must establish a quality system appropriate for the devices they manufacture. Labeling regulations, including unique device identification; Medical device reporting, or MDR, regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfuncti1d in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur; and Medical device correction and removal (recall) regulations with their associated reporting obligations. Additionally, we and the manufacturing facilities of some of our suppliers are subject to unannounced inspections by the FDA to determine our compliance with the QSR and other applicable regulations described above. The FDA can issue Form 483 Notices of Observation, warning letters or untitled letters, seek a court order detaining or seizing certain devices, seek an injunction, suspend regulatory clearance or approvals, ban certain medical devices, order repair, replacement or refund of those devices and require notification of health professionals and others with regard to medical devices that present risks of substantial harm to the public health. The FDA may also initiate action for criminal prosecution of violations. The FDA also may require post market testing, surveillance, or other measures to monitor the effects of an approved or cleared product. The FDA may place conditions on a PMA approved device that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. In addition, quality control, manufacture, packaging, and labeling procedures must continue to conform to QSRs after approval and clearance, and manufacturers are subject to periodic inspections by the FDA. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, m1y, and effort in the areas of production and quality control to maintain compliance with QSRs. The FDA may withdraw product approvals or recommend or require product recalls if a company fails to comply with regulatory requirements. Advertising, marketing and promotional activities for devices are also subject to FDA oversight. The failure to comply with the requirements applicable to these activities can result in FDA enforcement action. Manufacturers of medical devices are permitted to promote products solely for the uses and indications set forth in the approved or cleared product labeling. Promotion of products for uses not described in the approved or cleared labeling ( off label uses) has resulted in enforcement actions against manufacturers, including actions alleging violation of the Federal False Claims Act, federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws, and state consumer protection laws. The failure to comply with prohibitions on off label promotion can result in significant m1tary penalties, suspension of sales of certain products, product recalls, civil or criminal sanctions, exclusion from participating in federal healthcare programs, or other enforcement actions. In the United States, allegations of such wrongful conduct could also result in a corporate integrity agreement with the U.S. government that imposes significant administrative obligations and costs. 10 Table of Contents Requirements Outside the U.S. The regulatory review process varies from country to country and may in some cases require the submission of clinical data. Our international sales are subject to regulatory requirements in the countries in which our products are sold. For example, the EU has adopted the EU Medical Device Regulation (the "EU MDR") and the EU In Vitro Diagnostic Regulation (the "EU IVDR"), each of which impose stricter requirements for the marketing and sale of medical devices, including in the area of clinical evaluation requirements, quality systems and postmarket surveillance, than the current medical device directives they replace. The EU MDR is fully applicable as of May 26, 2021, and the EU IVDR as of May 26, 2022 There is a transition period for devices with a notified body certificate with an expiry date after the date of full application. However, a new EU certificate under the applicable Regulations must be obtained before that expiry date if there is to be no interruption in manufacturing and supply of devices to the market. There are nevertheless a number of provisions that need to be complied with from the date of application, including updating the postmarket surveillance process, appointing an importer for the EU, appointing a person responsible for regulatory compliance, and updating economic operator agreements. Complying with the requirements of these regulations may require us to incur significant expenditures. Failure to meet these requirements could adversely impact our business in the EU and other regions that tie their product registrations to the EU requirements. Drug Regulation Development and Approval Under the FDCA, FDA approval of a new drug application, or NDA, is generally required before any new drug can be marketed in the U.S. NDAs require extensive studies and submission of a large amount of data by the applicant. A generic version of an approved drug is approved by means of an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, by which the sponsor demonstrates that the proposed product is the same as the approved, brand name drug, which is referred to as the reference listed drug, or RLD. Generally, an ANDA must contain data and information showing that the proposed generic product and RLD have the same active ingredient, in the same strength and dosage form, to be delivered via the same route of administration, are intended for the same uses and are bioequivalent. This more limited data set is in lieu of independently demonstrating the proposed product safety and effectiveness, which are inferred from the fact that the product is the same as the RLD, which the FDA previously found to be safe and effective. We currently hold NDAs and ANDAs for liquid solutions (including anticoagulants, intravenous saline and a red blood cell storage solution), which we sell with our blood comp1nt and whole blood collection systems. Post Approval Regulations After the FDA permits a drug to enter commercial distribution, numerous regulatory requirements continue to apply. These include the FDA's current cGMPs, which include a series of requirements relating to organization and training of personnel, buildings and facilities, equipment, control of comp1nts and drug product containers and closures, production and process controls, quality control and quality assurance, packaging and labeling controls, holding and distribution, and laboratory controls and records and reports. The FDA has also established labeling regulations, advertising and promotion requirements and restrictions; regulations regarding conducting recalls of product; and requirements relating to the reporting of adverse events. Failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements and restrictions in this area may subject a company to adverse publicity, such as warning letters, and enforcement action by the FDA, the Department of Justice, or the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, as well as state authorities. This could subject a company to a range of penalties that could have a significant commercial impact, including civil and criminal fines and entering into agreements with the government that materially restrict the manner in which a company promotes or distributes drug or biological products. Requirements Outside the U.S. We must obtain the requisite marketing authorizations from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to marketing of a product in those countries. The requirements and process governing product licensing vary from country to country. If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, warning letters or untitled letters, injunctions, civil, administrative, or criminal penalties, m1tary fines or imprisonment, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, suspension of ongoing clinical studies, refusal to approve pending applications or 11 Table of Contents supplements to applications filed by us, suspension or the imposition of restrictions on operations, product recalls, the refusal to permit the import or export of our products or the seizure or detention of products. Conflict Minerals The Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act imposes disclosure requirements regarding the use of Conflict Minerals mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries in products, whether or not these products are manufactured by third parties. The conflict minerals include tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold and their derivatives. These requirements could affect the pricing, sourcing and availability of minerals used in the manufacture of our products. There may be material additional costs associated with complying with the disclosure requirements, such as costs related to determining the source of any conflict minerals used in our products. Our supply chain is complex and we may be unable to verify the origins for all metals used in our products as well as costs of possible changes to products processes, or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities. Fraud and Abuse Laws We are subject to fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we market, sell and distribute our products. In addition, we are subject to transparency laws and patient privacy regulation by U.S. federal and state governments and by governments in foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. We have described below some of the key federal, state and foreign healthcare laws and regulations that apply to our business. The federal healthcare program Anti Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable, in whole or in part, under Medicare, Medicaid or other federally financed healthcare programs. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between manufacturers of federally reimbursed products on 1 hand and prescribers, purchasers and others in a position to recommend, refer, or order federally reimbursed products on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and practices that involve remuneration to those who prescribe, purchase, or recommend medical devices or pharmaceutical and biological products, including certain discounts, or engaging consultants as speakers or consultants, may be subject to scrutiny if they do not fit squarely within the exemption or safe harbor. Our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for safe harbor protection from anti kickback liability. Moreover, there are no safe harbors for many common practices, such as educational and research grants. Liability may be established without a person or entity having actual knowledge of the federal Anti Kickback Statute or specific intent to violate it. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including Item or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act. The federal civil False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false, fraudulent or materially incomplete claim for payment of government funds, or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used, a false record or statement material to an obligation to pay m1y to the government or knowingly concealing or knowingly and improperly avoiding, decreasing, or concealing an obligation to pay m1y to the federal government. In recent years, companies in the healthcare industry have faced enforcement actions under the federal False Claims Act for, among other things, allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product or causing false claims to be submitted because of the company marketing the product for unapproved and thus non reimbursable, uses. False Claims Act liability is potentially significant in the healthcare industry because the statute provides for treble damages and mandatory penalties of tens of thousands of dollars per false claim or statement. Healthcare companies also are subject to other federal false claims laws, including, among others, federal criminal healthcare fraud and false statement statutes that extend to non government health benefit programs. The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, among other things, imposes criminal and civil liability for knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third party payers and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, Item or services. In addition, the Physician Payment Sunshine Act, implemented as the Open Payments program, requires manufacturers of certain products reimbursed by Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children Health Insurance Program to track and report information 12 Table of Contents to the federal government on certain payments or transfers of value that they make to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Beginning calendar year 2021, manufacturers must collect information regarding payments and other transfers of value to physician assistants, nurse practiti1rs, clinical nurse specialists, anesthesiologist assistants, certified registered nurse anesthetists, and certified nurse midwives for reporting in 2022 The reported data is made available in searchable form on a public website on an annual basis. Failure to submit required information may result in civil m1tary penalties. Many states have adopted analogous laws and regulations, including state anti kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to Item or services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs or, in several states, regardless of the payer. Several states have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical and medical device companies to, among other things, establish marketing compliance programs; file periodic reports with the state, including reports on gifts and payments to individual health care providers; make periodic public disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, clinical trials and other activities; and or register their sales representatives. Some states prohibit specified sales and marketing practices, including the provision of gifts, meals, or other Item to certain health care providers and or offering co pay support to patients for certain prescription drugs. Other countries, including a number of EU Member States, have laws of similar application. Environmental Matters Failure to comply with international, federal and local environmental protection laws or regulations could have an adverse impact on our business or could require material capital expenditures. We continue to monitor changes in U.S. and international environmental regulations that may present a significant risk to the business, including laws or regulations relating to the manufacture or sale of products using plastics. Human Capital Our employees are the foundation of our organization, each with their own talents, backgrounds and abilities. As of April 3, 2021, we employed the full time equivalent of 2,708 persons. Approximately 79% of our employees are located in the U.S. and the remaining 21% are located across 19 other countries. In our industry, there is substantial competition for key personnel in the regions in which we operate. Recruiting, developing and retaining talented employees is critical to both our strategy and our ability to compete effectively in the markets we serve. We are committed to building a collaborative, performance driven culture that attracts and retains the best talent. We strive to do this by soliciting employee perspectives, investing in their development, promoting employee health and safety, providing competitive pay and benefits and recognizing that the diversity of our teams and their ideas helps build our culture and strengthens our ability to make our work matter for the customers, patients, donors and healthcare providers who depend on us. These efforts include Employee Engagement . We conduct an annual employee engagement survey, with at least 90% global participation since fiscal 2018. Feedback from these surveys is shared across the organization and informs both Company sponsored initiatives and shared action plans between managers and direct reports. Employee Development . We offer a variety of programs and resources designed to facilitate our employees career development, training and ne2rking, including Manager development sessions focused on leadership skills, such as performance management training, coaching and feedback; Continuous improvement training for colleagues in functions that can best leverage and utilize process improvement practices; Best in class learning management system and dynamic content libraries aimed to meet the individual needs of colleagues current and future goals and aspirations; and Tuition reimbursement to support degree programs and certifications. 13 Table of Contents Competitive Pay and Benefits . We offer market competitive base pay and benefits to our employees around the world. Most of our employees also have variable comp1nts to their compensation that are tied to achievement of corporate and individual performance goals, the fluctuations of our stock price, or a combination of both. We also offer an Employee Stock Purchase Plan to eligible employees, consistent with our philosophy that compensation should align the interests of employees and shareholders and promote a long term shareholder perspective. Health and Safety . As a Company, we are also committed to making our workplaces safe and secure. This includes eliminating unsafe work practices and workplace injuries and illnesses and promoting the health, safety and well being of all employees, contractors and visitors. Important objectives in achieving our vision include creating a positive safety culture, maintaining an effective safety management system and reducing risk in the workplace. Our response to the COVID 19 pandemic has focused on business continuity and the safety of our employees. This includes prioritizing employee safety with remote work and travel restrictions, and limiting exposure for our manufacturing and customer facing employees, including field service and sales teams, to ensure supplies and support for our customers. Diversity, Equity and Inclusion . The diversity of our teams and their ideas helps build our collaborative, performance driven culture. We understand the value that each individual brings to our workplace, and we are committed to providing an inclusive environment where every individual has the opportunity to thrive. Additionally, we encourage colleagues with shared interests and affinities to connect and learn from 1 another. Availability of Reports and Other Information All of our corporate governance materials, including the Principles of Corporate Governance, Code of Conduct and the charters of the Audit, Compensation, Governance and Compliance and Technology Committees are published on the Investor Relations section of our website at www.haem1tics.com . On this website the public can also access, free of charge, our annual, quarterly and current reports and other documents filed or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the SEC.

Because forward looking statements are based on current beliefs, expectations and assumptions regarding future events, they are subject to uncertainties, risks and changes that are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of the Company's control. Investors should realize that if underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, or known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, the Company actual results and financial condition could vary materially from expectations and projections expressed or implied in its forward looking statements. Investors are therefore cauti1d not to rely on these forward looking statements. The following are some important factors that could cause our actual results to differ from our expectations in any forward looking statements. For further discussion of these and other factors, see Item 1A. Risk Factors in this report. The effect of the ongoing COVID 19 pandemic, or outbreaks of communicable diseases, on our business, financial conditions and results of operations, including the time it will take for vaccines to be broadly distributed and accepted in the U.S. and the rest of the world, and the effectiveness of such vaccines in slowing or stopping the spread of COVID 19 and mitigating the economic effects of the pandemic; Failure to achieve our long term strategic and financial improvement goals; 14 Table of Contents Demand for and market acceptance risks for new and existing products, including material reductions in purchasing from or loss of a significant customer; Product quality or safety concerns, leading to product recalls, withdrawals, regulatory action by the FDA (or similar non U.S. regulatory agencies), reputational damage, declining sales or litigation; Security breaches of our information technology systems or our products, which could impair our ability to conduct business or compromise sensitive information of the Company or its customers, suppliers and other business partners, or of customers' patients; Pricing pressures resulting from trends toward healthcare cost containment, including the continued consolidation among healthcare providers and other market participants; The continuity, availability and pricing of plastic and other raw materials, finished goods and comp1nts used in the manufacturing of our products (including those purchased from sole source suppliers) and the related continuity of our manufacturing, sterilization, supply and distribution; Our ability to develop, manufacture and market new products and technologies successfully and in a timely manner and the ability of our competitors and other third parties to develop products or technologies that render our products or technologies noncompetitive or obsolete; Our ability to obtain the anticipated benefits of restructuring programs that we have or may undertake, including the Operational Excellence Program; The potential that the expected strategic benefits and opportunities from our acquisition of Cardiva and any other planned or completed acquisition or divestiture by the Company may not be realized or may take longer to realize than expected; The impact of enhanced requirements to obtain regulatory approval in the U.S. and around the world and the associated timing and cost of product approval; Our ability to comply with established and developing U.S. and foreign legal and regulatory requirements, including FCPA, MDR and similar laws in other jurisdictions, as well as U.S. and foreign export and import restrictions and tariffs; Our ability to meet our debt obligations and raise additional capital when desired on terms reasonably acceptable to us; The potential impact of our convertible senior notes and related capped call transactions; Our ability to execute and realize anticipated benefits from our investments in emerging economies; The potential effect of foreign currency fluctuations and interest rate fluctuations on our net sales, expenses, and resulting margins; The impact of changes in U.S. and international tax laws; Our ability to protect intellectual property and the outcome of patent litigation; Costs and risks associated with product liability and other litigation claims; Our ability to retain and attract key personnel; and Market conditions impacting our stock price and or share repurchase programs we may enter into from time to time, and the possibility that such share repurchase programs may be delayed, suspended or discontinued. 15 Table of Contents Investors should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors and should not consider the risks described above and in Item 1A. Risk Factors to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties. The Company does not undertake to publicly update any forward looking statement that may be made from time to time, whether as a result of new information or future events or developments. 16 Table of Contents ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS In addition to the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10 K and the exhibits hereto, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our business. Our business, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks. This section contains forward looking statements. Please refer to the cautionary statements made under the heading Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward Looking Information at the end of Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K for more information on the qualifications and limitations on forward looking statements. Risks Related to the COVID 19 Pandemic The outbreak of communicable diseases could have, and the ongoing COVID 19 pandemic and its related effects are having, a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations, and we are unable to predict the extent to which COVID 19 and its related impacts will continue to adversely affect our Company and the achievement of our strategic objectives. The COVID 19 outbreak has significantly impacted economic activity and markets around the world and is negatively impacting our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations in numerous ways, including, but not limited to, those outlined below. We are unable to predict the extent to which COVID 19 and its related impacts will continue to negatively affect our Company, including the time it will take for vaccines to be broadly distributed and accepted in the U.S. and the rest of the world, and the effectiveness of such vaccines in slowing or stopping the spread of COVID 19 and mitigating the economic effects of the pandemic Product Demand . As a result of COVID 19, we have experienced both decreased demand and increased volatility in demand for our products. Lower collection volumes at source plasma collection centers due to COVID 19 factors, including stay at home and other government orders designed to slow the spread of COVID 19, donor safety concerns, reduced donor collection capacity due to shutdowns and social distancing requirements, and government economic relief programs that may reduce the propensity of people to be donors, have adversely affected and likely will continue to adversely affect demand for our Plasma disposable products. Additionally, reductions in elective surgeries and trauma cases, restrictions on vendor access at customer sites and the reallocation of hospital resources to address critical intensive care needs during the COVID 19 pandemic have reduced and will likely continue to reduce demand for our Hospital products. We also have experienced, and may continue to experience, in certain markets rapid and unpredictable changes in demand for some of our Blood Center disposable products as blood collectors seek to replenish their blood product inventories and safety stocks. Such changes could impact our ability to meet demand on a timely basis or could result in potential reductions in demand in future periods if safety stock levels in certain markets return to pre COVID 19 levels or the supply of blood held by our customers significantly exceeds the demand for blood from hospitals due to declines of elective surgeries and trauma cases. Manufacturing, Supply Chain and Distribution System Disruption . COVID 19 and its associated economic disruptions could have an adverse impact on our manufacturing capacity, supply chains and distribution systems, including as a result of impacts associated with preventive and precautionary measures that we, other businesses and governments are taking and financial difficulties experienced by our third party manufacturers and suppliers. Although we have not experienced significant manufacturing or supply chain difficulties to date as a result of COVID 19, we may in the future. A reduction or interruption in any of our manufacturing processes could have a material adverse effect on our business. Potential Liquidity and Credit Impacts . While we have significant sources of cash and liquidity and access to committed credit lines, we may be adversely impacted by delays in payments of outstanding receivables if our customers experience financial difficulties or are unable to borrow m1y to fund their operations, which may adversely impact their ability to pay for our products on a timely basis, if at all, which in turn would adversely affect our financial condition. These and other impacts of COVID 19 may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in the Risk Factors section of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. We believe the magnitude of the adverse impact of these factors on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations will be primarily driven by the severity and duration of the COVID 19 pandemic, including the time it will take for vaccines to be broadly distributed and accepted in the U.S. and the rest of the world; the timing, scope and effectiveness of governmental responses to the COVID 19 pandemic and associated economic disruptions; general confidence about personal health and safety; and the COVID 19 pandemic impact on U.S. and international healthcare systems, the U.S. economy and the worldwide economy. 17 Table of Contents Risks Related to our Business and Industry If our business strategy does not yield the expected results or we fail to implement the necessary changes to our operations, we could see material adverse effects on our business, financial condition or results of operations. We view our operations and manage our business in 3 principal reporting segments Plasma, Blood Center and Hospital. We believe that Plasma and Hospital have growth potential, while Blood Center competes in challenging markets that require us to manage the business differently, including reducing costs, shrinking the scope of the current product line and evaluating opportunities to exit unfavorable customer contracts. If we have not correctly identified the product categories with greatest growth potential, we will not allocate our resources appropriately which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Further, if we are unable to reduce costs and complexity in our Blood Center business unit, we will obtain lower than expected cash flows to fund our future growth and capital needs. This could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and results of operations. Material reductions in purchasing from or loss of a significant customer could adversely affect our business. In fiscal 2021, our 2 largest Plasma customers each accounted for more than 10% of our net revenues and our ten largest customers accounted for approximately 49% of our net revenues. In April 2021, 1 of these customers, CSL, informed us of its intent not to renew its supply agreement for the use of PCS2 plasma collection system devices and the purchase of disposable plasmapheresis kits in the U.S. following the expiration of the current term in June 2022 In addition to the anticipated financial impact of the non renewal of the CSL supply agreement in June 2022, we could experience an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition if any of our other largest customers materially reduce their purchases from us or terminate their relationship with us for any reason, including material decreases in demand for plasma or development of alternative processes. If we are unable to negotiate competitive pricing or generate adequate disposable sales volumes from customers following conversion to our NexSys PCS platform, we may not realize the intended benefits of our investment. We have focused heavily on the development and commercialization of our NexSys platform, comprised of both the NexSys PCS plasmapheresis system and NexLynk DMS software, and continuous platform innovation as reflected in our receipt of FDA clearance for NexSys PCS with Persona technology during fiscal 2021 Since the commercial launch of our NexSys platform in fiscal 2019, we have entered into long term contracts with each of our major customers that provide for conversion to NexSys within some portion of their collection ne2rk. If we fail to receive pricing or generate disposable sales volumes from customers following conversion to our NexSys PCS platform that provide an adequate return on our investment, we may not realize the full intended benefits of our investment. Defects or quality issues associated with our products could adversely affect the results of operations. Quality is extremely important to us and our customers due to the serious and costly consequences of product failure. Manufacturing or design defects, comp1nt failures, unapproved or improper use of our products, or inadequate disclosure of risks or other information relating to the use of our products can lead to injury or other serious adverse events. These events could lead to recalls or safety alerts relating to our products (either voluntary or as required by the FDA or similar governmental authorities in other countries), and could result, in certain cases, in the removal of a product from the market. A recall could result in significant costs and lost sales and customers, enforcement actions and or investigations by state and federal governments or other enforcement bodies, as well as negative publicity and damage to our reputation that could reduce future demand for our products. Personal injuries relating to the use of our products can also result in significant product liability claims being brought against us. In some circumstances, such adverse events could also cause delays in regulatory approval of new products or the imposition of post market approval requirements. We are increasingly dependent on information technology systems and subject to privacy and security laws and a cyber attack or other breach of these systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. We increasingly rely on information technology systems, including cloud based computing, to process, transmit and store electronic information for our day to day operations and for our customers, including sensitive personal information and proprietary or confidential information. Additionally, certain of our products collect data regarding patients and donors and connect to our systems for maintenance and other purposes or are actively managed by Haem1tics on behalf of specific 18 Table of Contents customers. Similar to other large multi national companies, the size and complexity of our information technology systems makes them vulnerable to a cyber attack, malicious intrusion, breakdown, destruction, loss of data privacy, or other significant disruption. We also outsource certain elements of our information technology systems to third parties that, as a result of this outsourcing, could have access to certain confidential information and whose systems may also be vulnerable to these types of attacks or disruptions. Security threats, including cyber and other attacks are becoming increasingly sophisticated, frequent, and adaptive and, like other large multi national companies, we have experienced cyber incidents in the past and may experience them in the future. Accordingly, our information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain, protect and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology, evolving systems and regulatory standards, the increasing need to protect patient and customer information and changing customer patterns. Although prior cyber incidents have not had a material effect on our business and we have invested and continue to invest in the protection of personal information and proprietary or confidential information, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent cyber attacks, intrusions, breakdowns or other incidents or ensure compliance with all applicable securities and privacy laws, regulations, standard standards. In addition, third parties may attempt to hack into our products to obtain data relating to patients with our products or our proprietary information. Any failure by us or third parties we work with to maintain or protect our respective information technology systems and data integrity, including from cyber attacks, intrusions or other breaches, could result in the unauthorized access to patient data and personally identifiable information, theft of intellectual property or other misappropriation of assets, or otherwise compromise our confidential or proprietary information and disrupt our operations. Any of these events, in turn, may cause us to lose existing customers, have difficulty preventing, detecting and controlling fraud, have disputes with customers, physicians and other healthcare professionals, be subject to legal claims and liability, have regulatory sanctions or penalties imposed, have increases in operating expenses, incur expenses or lose revenues as a result of a data privacy breach or theft of intellectual property, or suffer other adverse consequences, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Additionally, the legal and regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding, with the imposition of new and changing requirements across businesses. We are required to comply with increasingly complex and changing legal and regulatory requirements that govern the collection, use, storage, security, transfer, disclosure and other processing of personal data in the United States and in other countries, including, but not limited to, HIPAA, HITECH, the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, and the EU General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR. The GDPR imposes stringent EU data protection requirements and provides for significant penalties for noncompliance. HIPAA also imposes stringent data privacy and security requirements and the regulatory authority has imposed significant fines and penalties on organizations found to be out of compliance. CCPA provides consumers with a private right of action against companies who have a security breach due to lack of appropriate security measures. We or our third party providers and business partners may also be subjected to audits or investigations by 1 or more domestic or foreign government agencies relating to compliance with information security and privacy laws and regulations, and noncompliance with the laws and regulations could results in material fines or litigation. We outsource certain aspects of our business to a single third party vendor that subjects us to risks, including disruptions in business and increased costs. Currently, we rely on a single vendor to support several of our business processes, including customer service and support and elements of enterprise technology, procurement, accounting and human resources. We make diligent efforts to ensure that the provider of these outsourced services is observing proper internal control practices. However, there are no guarantees that failures will not occur. Accordingly, we are subject to the risks associated with the vendor ability to successfully provide the necessary services to meet our needs. If our vendor is unable to adequately protect our data or information is lost, if our ability to deliver our services is interrupted (including as a result of significant outbreaks of disease, including the ongoing COVID 19 pandemic, natural disasters, strikes, terrorism attacks or other adverse events in the countries in which the vendor operates), if our vendor's fees are higher than expected, if our vendor makes mistakes in the execution of operations support, or if the vendor terminates our relationship, then our business and operating results may be negatively affected. A significant portion of our revenue derives from the sale of blood collection supplies. Declines in the number of blood collection procedures have adversely impacted our business and future declines may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The demand for whole blood disposable products in the U.S. continued to decrease in fiscal 2021 due to sustained declines in transfusion rates caused by hospitals' improved blood management techniques and protocols. In response to this trend, U.S. 19 Table of Contents blood center collection groups prefer single source vendors for their whole blood collection products and are primarily focused on obtaining the lowest average selling prices. We expect to see continued declines in transfusion rates and the market to remain price focused and highly competitive for the foreseeable future. Continued declines in this market could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and results of operations. Consolidation of healthcare providers and blood collectors, healthcare cost containment pressures, government payment and delivery system reforms and changes in private payer policies could decrease demand for our products, the prices which customers are willing to pay for those products and or the number of procedures performed using our devices, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Political, economic and policy influences are causing the healthcare and blood collection industries to make substantial structural and financial changes that affect our results of operations. Government and private sector initiatives limiting the growth of healthcare costs are causing structural reforms in healthcare delivery, including the reduction in blood use and reduced payments for care. These trends have placed greater pricing pressure on suppliers and, in some cases, decreased average selling prices and increased the number of sole source relationships. This pressure impacts our Hospital and Blood Center businesses. Our Vascular Closure devices, for example, are often perceived as physician preference devices with a relatively higher price point compared to certain vascular closure alternatives such as sutures or manual compression, and purchases are commonly made by a hospital only after approval by its value analysis committee. If a hospital value analysis committee does not approve or revokes prior approval for any of the reasons set forth above, the demand for our vascular closure devices may decrease and we could experience an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. The influence of integrated delivery ne2rks, group purchasing organizations and large single accounts has the potential to put price pressure on our Hospital business. It also puts price pressure on our U.S. Blood Center customers who are also facing reduced demand for red cells. Our Blood Center customers have responded to this pressure by creating their own group purchasing organizations and resorting to single source tenders to create incentives for suppliers, including us, to significantly reduce prices. We expect that market demand, government regulation, third party reimbursement policies, government contracting requirements and societal pressures will continue to change the worldwide healthcare industry, resulting in further business consolidations and alliances among our customers and competitors. This may exert further downward pressure on the prices of our products and adversely impact our business, financial condition or results of operations. An interruption in our ability to manufacture our products, obtain key comp1nts or raw materials, or the failure of a sole source supplier or sterilization service provider may adversely affect our business. We have a complex global supply chain that involves integrating key suppliers and our manufacturing capacity into a global movement of comp1nts and finished goods. We manufacture certain key disposables and devices at single locations with limited alternate facilities. If an event occurs that results in the closure of or damage to 1 or more of these facilities, we may be unable to supply the relevant products at previous levels or at all for some period. Additionally, for reasons of quality assurance or cost effectiveness, we purchase certain finished goods, comp1nts and raw materials from sole suppliers who have their own complex supply chains. Any disruption to 1 or more of our suppliers production or delivery of sufficient volumes of comp1nts conforming to our specifications, could disrupt or delay our ability to deliver finished products to our customers. For example, we purchase comp1nts in Asia for use in manufacturing in the U.S. and Mexico. We source all of our apheresis equipment from Asia and regularly ship finished goods from the U.S. and Mexico to the rest of the world. Some of our products require sterilization prior to sale or distribution, and we utilize third party facilities for this process. If an event occurs that results in damage to or closure, whether temporarily or permanent, of 1 or more of these facilities, we may be unable to manufacture or sterilize the relevant products at prior levels or at all, and a third party may not be available on a timely basis (if at all) to replace sterilization capacity. In addition, we manufacture our vascular closure devices under a shelter plan service agreement with Offshore International Incorporated (d b a Tetakawi), or Tetakawi, pursuant to which we lease our manufacturing facility in Guaymas, Mexico and Tetakawi is responsible for a number of ongoing services related to the facility, including provision of external security and maintenance, manufacturing personnel related human resource matters, recruiting support, government compliance, workforce transportation and cross border shipping of raw comp1nts. We are reliant on Tetakawi to provide these services and any disruption in these services or our failure to maintain our contractual relationship with Tetakawi could significantly harm our 20 Table of Contents ability to manufacture our vascular closure devices and maintain sufficient quality standards, which would negatively impact our business and results of operations. Due to the high standards and stringent requirements of the FDA and other similar non U.S. regulatory agencies applicable to manufacturing our products, such as the FDA's Quality System Regulation, or QSR, and current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP, regulations, we may not be able to quickly establish additional or replacement sources for certain raw materials, comp1nts or finished goods. A reduction or interruption in manufacturing, or an inability to secure alternative sources of raw materials, comp1nts or finished goods on commercially reasonable terms or in a timely manner, could compromise our ability to manufacture our products on a timely and cost competitive basis, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Plastics are the principal comp1nt of our disposables, which are the main source of our revenues. Any change in the price, composition or availability of the plastics or resins we purchase could adversely affect our business. We face risks related to price, composition and availability of the plastic raw materials used in our business. Climate change (including laws or regulations passed in response thereto) could increase our costs, in particular our costs of supply, energy and transportation freight. Material or sustained increases in the price of petroleum or petroleum derivatives could have an adverse impact on the costs to procure plastic raw materials and the costs of our transportation freight. Increases in the costs of other commodities also may affect our procurement costs to a lesser degree. The composition of the plastic we purchase is also important. Today, we purchase plastics that contain phthalates, which are used to make plastic malleable. Due to regulatory changes, we may be required to remove materials such as phthalates from our devices, find alternative materials which then need to be validated or obtain regulatory approvals from the regulatory authorities for a number of products. While we have not experienced significant shortages in the past, any interruption in the supply for certain plastics could have a material impact on our business by limiting our ability to manufacture and sell the products that represent a significant portion of our revenues. These outcomes may in turn result in customers transitioning to available competitive products, loss of market share, negative publicity, reputational damage, loss of customer confidence or other negative consequences (including a decline in stock price). We may not realize the benefits we expect from our Operational Excellence Program. In July 2019, our Board of Directors approved a new Operational Excellence Program, also referred to in this report as the 2020 Program, and delegated authority to management to determine the detail of the initiatives that will comprise the program. The 2020 Program is designed to improve operational performance and reduce cost principally in our manufacturing and supply chain operations. While cost savings from the 2020 Program to date have been consistent with our expectations, it is possible that events and circumstances, such as CSL's non renewal of its U.S. supply agreement in June 2022, other financial or strategic difficulties, delays and unexpected costs, including as a direct or indirect result of the COVID 19 pandemic, could result in our not realizing all of the anticipated benefits or our not realizing the anticipated benefits on our expected timetable. Our inability to realize all of the anticipated benefits from the 2020 Program could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. We face intense competition, and if we are unable to successfully expand our product lines through internal research and new product development or keep pace with rapid technological changes in the healthcare industry, our business may be materially and adversely affected. A significant element of our strategy is to increase revenue growth by focusing on innovation and new product development. The medical device markets in which we participate, however, are highly competitive. We encounter significant competition across our product lines and in each market in which our products are sold from various medical device companies, some of whom have greater financial and marketing resources than we do. In addition, the medical device markets in which we participate and healthcare industry generally are characterized by extensive research and development and rapid technological change. New product development requires significant investment in research and development, clinical trials and regulatory approvals. The results of our product development efforts may be affected by a number of factors, including our ability to anticipate customer needs, innovate and develop new products and technologies, successfully complete clinical trials, obtain regulatory approvals in the United States and abroad, manufacture products in a cost effective manner, obtain appropriate intellectual 21 Table of Contents property protection for our products, and gain and maintain market acceptance of our products. In addition, patents attained by others could preclude or delay our commercialization of a product. There can be no assurance that any products now in development or that we may seek to develop in the future will achieve technological feasibility, obtain regulatory approval or gain market acceptance. If we fail to develop new products or enhance existing products, or if competitive technologies or therapeutic alternatives to plasma derived pharmaceuticals in development, such as FcRn targeted therapies, emerge and gain market acceptance, such events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, a delay in the timing of the launch of next generation products and the overall performance of, and continued customer confidence in, those products may result in declines in our market share and have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. If our business development activities are unsuccessful, we may not realize the intended benefits. We have sought and in the future may seek to supplement our organic growth through strategic acquisitions, investments and alliances. Such transactions are inherently risky and require significant effort and management attention. The success of any acquisition, investment or alliance, including our recent acquisition of Cardiva may be affected by a number of factors, including our ability to properly assess and value the potential business opportunity or to successfully integrate any business we may acquire into our existing business. We anticipate that a significant amount of management attention will be required in the integration of Cardiva, and that a material factor in achieving the anticipated benefits of the Cardiva acquisition will be our ability to effectively and profitably market and sell the vascular closure devices acquired from Cardiva. Also as a result of the Cardiva acquisition, we have entered into a new line of business. Unlike our existing products, the VASCADE and VASCADE MVP vascular closure devices are designated as Class III medical devices, which are subject to additional and complex regulatory requirements. Complying with these regulations will be costly, time consuming and complex. Furthermore, any new business line and or new product or service could have an adverse impact on the effectiveness of our system of internal controls. Promising partnerships and acquisitions may also not be completed for reasons such as competition among prospective partners or buyers, the inability to reach satisfactory terms, the need for regulatory approvals or the existence of economic conditions affecting our access to capital for acquisitions and other capital investments. If our business development activities are unsuccessful, we may not realize the intended benefits of such activities, including that acquisition and integration costs may be greater than expected or the possibility that expected return on investment synergies and accretion will not be realized or will not be realized within the expected timeframe. Risks Related to Government Regulation As a medical device and drug manufacturer, we operate in a highly regulated industry, and non compliance with applicable laws or regulations could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. The manufacture, distribution and marketing of our products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other state and non U.S. regulatory bodies. Our operations are also subject to review and monitoring by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. Government regulation of medical devices is meant to assure their safety and effectiveness, and includes regulation of, among other things, the product development, testing, premarket clearance and approval, manufacture, marketing, labeling, post market surveillance, reporting, and imports and exports. Before a new medical device, or a new use of an existing product can be marketed in the United States, it must first receive either premarket clearance under Section 510(k) of the U.S. Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, a grant of a request for de novo classification or a Premarket Approval, or PMA, from the FDA, unless an exemption applies. The process of obtaining regulatory clearances or approvals to market a medical device can be costly and time consuming, and we may not be able to obtain these clearances or approvals on a timely basis, if at all. Many of our currently commercialized products have received 510(k) clearance. In the future, the FDA may determine that our products will require more costly, lengthy and uncertain de novo or PMA processes. Modifications to Class III devices, like the Vascular Closure products we acquired from Cardiva in March 2021, may require additional clinical studies or supplemental PMA submissions. If the FDA requires us to go through a lengthier, more rigorous process for future products or modifications to existing products, our product introductions or modifications could be delayed or canceled, which could adversely affect our revenue. In addition, even if we do obtain clearance or approval, the FDA may not approve or clear these products for the indications that we requested. Any delay in, or failure to receive or maintain, clearances or approvals for our products under development could prevent us from generating revenue from these products. 22 Table of Contents Failure to substantially comply with applicable regulations could subject our products to recall or seizure of our products by government authorities, or an order to suspend manufacturing and distribution activities. If our products were determined to have design or manufacturing flaws, this could also result in their recall or seizure. Either of these situations could also result in the imposition of fines, administrative actions like untitled or warning letters, and other penalties or sanctions. Our products are also subject to approval and regulation by foreign regulatory and safety agencies. For example, the EU has adopted the EU Medical Device Regulation, or EU MDR, and EU In Vitro Diagnostic Regulation, or EU IVDR, each of which impose stricter requirements for the marketing and sale of medical devices beyond those of the current medical device directives they replace, including in the area of clinical evaluation requirements, quality systems and post market surveillance. The EU MDR is fully applicable as of May 26, 2021 and the EU IVDR is fully applicable as of May 26, 2022 There is a transition period for devices with a notified body certificate with an expiry date after the date of full application, provided that there are no significant changes to the design or intended use. However, a new EU certificate under the applicable regulations must be obtained before that expiry date if there is to be no interruption in manufacturing and supply of devices to the market. Complying with the requirements of these regulations may require us to incur significant expenditures. Failure to meet these requirements could adversely impact our business in the EU and other regions that tie their product registrations to the EU requirements. If we or our suppliers fail to comply with laws and regulations governing the manufacture and production of our products, our products could be subject to restrictions or withdrawal from the market. Any product for which we obtain clearance or approval, and the manufacturing processes, reporting requirements, post approval clinical data and promotional activities for such product, will be subject to continued regulatory review, oversight and periodic inspection (both routine and unannounced) by the FDA and other domestic and foreign regulatory bodies. In particular, we and our third party suppliers must comply with the FDA's Quality System Regulation, or QSR, or current good manufacturing process, or cGMP, requirements (depending on the products at issue), which address, among other things, the methods of documentation of the design, testing, production, control, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, sterilization, storage and shipping of our products. Any future failure by us or 1 of our suppliers to comply with applicable statutes and regulations administered by the FDA or other regulatory authority could result in administrative actions, field actions, or civil or criminal enforcement actions. Furthermore, our key comp1nt suppliers may not currently be or may not continue to be in compliance with all applicable regulatory requirements, which could result in our failure to produce our products on a timely basis and in the required quantities, if at all. Any sanctions by the FDA or other regulatory authority could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition. We are also subject to environmental laws, which are becoming more stringent throughout the world. For example, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency regulates the use of ethylene oxide for sterilization of medical devices, and is increasingly focused on reducing emissions from the ethylene oxide sterilization process, which could increase our costs of operations and necessitate changes to our manufacturing plants and processes. Other environmental laws may have similar consequences to us or our suppliers, or result in liability to us. The enactment of additional environmental laws in the future may increase our compliance costs or otherwise adversely impact our operations. If our products cause or contribute to a death or serious injury, or malfunction in certain ways, we will be subject to medical device reporting requirements. Under the FDA's medical device reporting regulations, medical device manufacturers are required to report to the FDA information of which they become aware that a device has or may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfuncti1d in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction of the device or 1 of our similar devices were to recur. Similar reporting requirements exist in some of the other jurisdictions in which we operate. Failure to report these events to the FDA or other applicable regulatory authorities within the required timeframes, or at all, could lead to enforcement actions, fines and criminal sanctions against us. Class III medical devices are those that pose the highest risk to patients. As a result of the acquisition of our Vascular Closure products from Cardiva in March 2021, we may receive a greater number of complaints requiring investigation and potentially need to file a greater number of medical device reports with FDA, which may require additional time and resources. 23 Table of Contents Our relationships with customers and third party payers are subject to applicable anti kickback, fraud and abuse, transparency and other healthcare laws and regulations, which could expose us to criminal sanctions, civil penalties, exclusion, contractual damages, reputational harm and diminished profits and future earnings. We are subject to fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we market, sell and distribute our products. In addition, we are subject to transparency laws and patient privacy regulation by U.S. federal and state governments and by governments in foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. The shifting commercial compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust and expandable systems to comply with different compliance or reporting requirements in multiple jurisdictions increase the possibility that a healthcare or pharmaceutical company may fail to comply fully with 1 or more of these requirements. Efforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations may involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices do not comply with applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations or guidance, or anti bribery laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, or equivalent laws in other jurisdictions. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. If any of the physicians or other providers or entities with whom we expect to do business are found not to be in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from government funded healthcare programs. Even if we are not determined to have violated these laws, government investigations into these issues typically require the expenditure of significant resources and generate negative publicity, which could harm our financial condition and divert resources and the attention of our management from operating our business. Changes in tax laws or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations and or liquidity. We are subject to income taxes, non income based taxes and tax audits, in both the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions. Tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken and assess additional taxes. We regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision and have established contingency reserves for material, known tax exposures. However, the calculation of such tax exposures involves the application of complex tax laws and regulations in many jurisdictions, as well as interpretations as to the legality under various rules in certain jurisdictions. Therefore, there can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the outcomes of these disputes or other tax audits or that issues raised by tax authorities will be resolved at a financial cost that does not exceed our related reserves and the actual outcomes of these disputes and other tax audits could have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition. Changes in tax laws and regulations, or their interpretation and application, in the jurisdictions where we are subject to tax could materially impact our effective tax rate. For example, in 2017, the U.S. enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or the Act, and we expect the U.S. Treasury to issue future notices and regulations under the Act. Certain provisions of the Act and the regulations issued thereunder could have a significant impact on our future results of operations as could interpretations made by the Company in the absence of regulatory guidance and judicial interpretations. The change in administration and control of Congress in the U.S. following the 2020 elections may result in additional U.S. tax law changes that could have a material impact on our future effective tax rate. Additionally, the U.S. Congress, government agencies in non U.S. jurisdictions where we and our affiliates do business and the Organization for Economic Co operation and Development, or OECD, have recently focused on issues related to the taxation of multinational corporations. The OECD has released its comprehensive plan to create an agreed set of international rules for fighting base erosion and profit shifting. In addition, the OECD, the European Commission and individual countries are examining changes to how taxing rights should be allocated among countries in light of the digital economy. As a result, the tax laws in the U.S. and other countries in which we and our affiliates do business could change on a prospective or retroactive basis and any such changes could materially adversely affect our business. 24 Table of Contents Risks Related to our Financial Obligations and Indebtedness We have a significant amount of debt that may decrease our business flexibility, access to capital, and or increase our borrowing costs, and we may still incur additional debt in the future, which may adversely affect our operations and financial results. As of April 3, 2021, we had $500 million aggregate principal amount of indebtedness under our convertible senior notes due 2026 (the 2026 Notes ) as well as $350.0 million term loan (the Term Loan ) and access to a $350.0 million revolving loan (the Revolving Credit Facility and together with the Term Loan, the Credit Facilities ). As of April 3, 2021, we had $3019 million of debt outstanding under the Term Loan and no borrowings were outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility. Our Credit Facilities contain financial covenants that require us to maintain specified financial ratios that may limit our ability to borrow additional funds and that require us to make interest and principal payments. As of April 3, 2021, we were in compliance with the covenants pursuant to our Credit Facilities, and we currently forecast that we will be in compliance with our Credit Facility covenants through the period ending April 2, 2022 Our ability to pay our debt when due or refinance our indebtedness, including the Notes, depends on our future financial performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive, and other factors outside of our control. If we are not able to pay our debt when due or refinance our indebtedness on desirable terms such that we default on our debt obligations, our indebtedness could become immediately payable in full which could harm our financial condition, result of operation or cost of borrowing. The conditional conversion feature of the 2026 Notes, if triggered, may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results. Under certain circumstances, the noteholders may convert their 2026 Notes at their option prior to the scheduled maturities. If 1 or more noteholders elect to convert their 2026 Notes, we would be required to settle a portion or all of our conversion obligation through the payment of cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity. In addition, holders of our 2026 Notes will have the right to require us to repurchase their 2026 Notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change (as defined in the indenture, dated as of March 5, 2021, between U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the Trustee ) and us (the Indenture )), at a repurchase price equal to the principal amount of the 2026 Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid special interest, if any, to but not including, the fundamental change repurchase date. We may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to repurchase the 2026 Notes or pay the cash amounts due upon conversion. In addition, applicable law, regulatory authorities and the agreements governing our other indebtedness may restrict our ability to repurchase the 2026 Notes or pay the cash amounts due upon conversion. Our failure to repurchase 2026 Notes or to pay the cash amounts due upon conversion when required will constitute a default under the Indenture. A default under the Indenture or the fundamental change itself could also lead to a default under agreements governing our other indebtedness, including our Credit Facilities, which may result in that other indebtedness becoming immediately payable in full. We may not have sufficient funds to satisfy all amounts due under the other indebtedness and the Notes. Even if holders do not elect to convert their 2026 Notes, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the 2026 Notes as a current rather than long term liability, which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital. The Capped Call Transactions may affect the value of the 2026 Notes and our common stock. In connection with the 2026 Notes issuance, we entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions (the Capped Call Transactions ) with certain financial institutions (the Option Counterparties ). The Capped Call Transactions are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution to our common stock upon any conversion of the 2026 Notes and or offset any potential cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted Notes, as the case may be, with such reduction and or offset subject to a cap. From time to time, the Option Counterparties and or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to our common stock and or purchasing or selling our common stock or other securities of ours in secondary market transactions prior to the maturity of the 2026 Notes. This activity could also cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price of our common stock or the 2026 Notes. 25 Table of Contents We are subject to counterparty risk with respect to the Capped Call Transactions. The Option Counterparties are financial institutions, and we are subject to the risk that 1 or more of the Option Counterparties may default or otherwise fail to perform, or may exercise certain rights to terminate, their obligations under the Capped Call Transactions. Our exposure to the credit risk of the option counterparties is not secured by any collateral. Past global economic conditions have from time to time resulted in the actual or perceived failure or financial difficulties of many financial institutions. If an Option Counterparty becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at the time under such transactions with such Option Counterparty. Our exposure depends on many factors, but our exposure will generally increase if the market price or the volatility of our common stock increases. In addition, upon default by an Option Counterparty, we may suffer more dilution than we currently anticipate with respect to our common stock. We can provide no assurances as to the financial stability or viability of the Option Counterparties. In addition, the Capped Call Transactions are complex, and they may not operate as planned. For example, the terms of the Capped Call Transactions may be subject to adjustment, modification or, in some cases, renegotiation if certain corporate or other transactions occur. Accordingly, these transactions may not operate as we intend if we are required to adjust their terms as a result of transactions in the future or upon unanticipated developments that may adversely affect the functioning of the Capped Call Transactions. Provisions in the Indenture could delay or prevent an otherwise beneficial takeover of us. Certain provisions in the 2026 Notes and the Indenture could make a third party attempt to acquire us more difficult or expensive. For example, if a takeover constitutes a fundamental change, then noteholders will have the right to require us to repurchase their 2026 Notes for cash. In addition, if a takeover constitutes a make whole fundamental change, then we may be required to temporarily increase the conversion rate. In either case, and in other cases, our obligations under the 2026 Notes and the Indenture could increase the cost of acquiring us or otherwise discourage a third party from acquiring us or removing incumbent management, including in a transaction that noteholders or holders of our common stock may view as favorable. Conversion of the 2026 Notes may dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders. The conversion of some or all of the Notes will dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders to the extent we deliver shares of our common stock upon conversion of any of the 2026 Notes. Any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect our common stock prevailing market prices. In addition, the existence of the 2026 Notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the 2026 Notes could be used to satisfy short positions, or anticipated conversion of the 2026 Notes into shares of our common stock could depress the price of our common stock. Risks Related to Operating Internationally As a substantial amount of our revenue comes from outside the U.S., we are subject to geopolitical events, economic volatility, violations of anti corruption laws, export and import restrictions and tariffs, decisions by local regulatory authorities and the laws and medical practices in foreign jurisdictions. We do business in over 90 countries and have distributors in approximately 80 of these countries. This exposes us to currency fluctuation, geopolitical risk, economic volatility (such as the United Kingdom's exit from the EU, commonly referred to as "Brexit"), anti corruption laws, export and import restrictions, local regulatory authorities and the laws and medical practices in foreign jurisdictions. If there are sanctions or restrictions on the flow of capital that prevent product importation or receipt of payments in Russia or China, our business could be adversely affected. Our international operations are governed by the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, and other similar anti corruption laws in other countries. Generally, these laws prohibit companies and their business partners or other intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign governments and government officials in order to obtain or retain business. Global enforcement of such anti corruption laws has increased in recent years, including aggressive investigations and enforcement proceedings. While we have an active compliance program and various other safeguards to discourage impermissible practices, we have distributors in approximately 80 countries, several of which are considered high risk for corruption. As a result, our global operations carry some risk of unauthorized impermissible activity on the part of 1 of our distributors, employees, 26 Table of Contents agents or consultants. Any alleged or actual violation could subject us to government scrutiny, severe criminal or civil fines, or sanctions on our ability to export product outside the U.S., which could adversely affect our reputation and financial condition. Export of U.S. technology or goods manufactured in the U.S. to some jurisdictions requires special U.S. export authorization or local market controls that may be influenced by factors, including political dynamics, outside our control. Finally, any other significant changes in the competitive, legal, regulatory, reimbursement or economic environments of the jurisdictions in which we conduct our international business could have a material impact on our business. We sell our products in certain emerging economies which exposes us to less mature regulatory systems, more volatile markets for our products and greater credit risks. A loss of funding for our products or changes to the regulatory regime could lead to lost revenue or account receivables. There are risks with doing business in emerging economies, such as Brazil, Russia, India and China. These economies tend to have less mature product regulatory systems and more volatile financial markets. In addition, the government controlled healthcare system's ability to invest in our products and systems may abruptly shift due to changing government priorities or funding capacity. Our ability to sell products in these economies is dependent upon our ability to hire qualified employees or agents to represent our products locally and our ability to obtain and maintain the necessary regulatory approvals in a less mature regulatory environment. If we are unable to retain qualified representatives or maintain the necessary regulatory approvals, we will not be able to continue to sell products in these markets. We are exposed to a higher degree of financial risk if we extend credit to customers in these economies. In many of the international markets in which we do business, including certain parts of Europe, South America, the Middle East and Asia, our employees, agents or distributors offer to sell our products in response to public tenders issued by various governmental agencies. There is additional risk in selling our products through agents or distributors, particularly in public tenders. If they misrepresent our products, do not provide appropriate service and delivery, or commit a violation of local or U.S. law, our reputation could be harmed and we could be subject to fines, sanctions or both. We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations. International revenues and expenses account for a substantial portion of our operations. In fiscal 2021, our international revenues accounted for 40.0% of our total revenues. The exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates takes different forms. Reported revenues, as well as manufacturing and operational costs denominated in foreign currencies by our international businesses, fluctuate due to exchange rate movement when translated into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes. Fluctuations in exchange rates could adversely affect our profitability in U.S. dollars of products and services sold by us into international markets, where payment for our products and services and related manufacturing and operational costs is made in local currencies. Our effective tax rate may fluctuate and we may incur obligations in tax jurisdictions in excess of amounts that have been accrued. We are subject to taxation in numerous countries, states and other jurisdictions. In preparing our financial statements, we record the amount of tax payable in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. Our future effective tax rate, however, may be lower or higher than prior years due to numerous factors, including a change in our geographic earnings mix, changes in the measurement of our deferred taxes and recently enacted and future tax law changes in jurisdictions in which we operate. Changes in our operations, including headcount in Switzerland or Malaysia, could adversely affect our tax rate due to favorable tax rulings in these jurisdictions. We are also subject to tax audits in various jurisdictions and tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken and assess additional taxes. Any of these factors could cause us to experience an effective tax rate significantly different from previous periods or our current expectations, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and cash flows. 27 Table of Contents Risks Related to Intellectual Property and Litigation There is a risk that our intellectual property may be subject to misappropriation in some countries. Certain countries, particularly China, do not enforce compliance with laws that protect intellectual property rights with the same degree of vigor as is available under the U.S. and European systems of justice. Further, certain of our intellectual property rights are not registered in China, or if they were, have since expired. This may permit others to produce copies of products in China that are not covered by currently valid patent registrations. There is also a risk that such products may be exported from China to other countries. In order to aggressively protect our intellectual property throughout the world, we have a program of patent disclosures and filings in markets where we conduct significant business. While we believe this program is reasonable and adequate, the risk of loss is inherent in litigation as different legal systems offer different levels of protection to intellectual property and it is still possible that even patented technologies may not be protected absolutely from infringement. Pending and future intellectual property litigation could be costly and disruptive to us. We operate in an industry that is susceptible to significant intellectual property litigation. This type of litigation is expensive, complex and lengthy and its outcome is difficult to predict. Patent litigation may result in adverse outcomes and could significantly divert the attention of our technical and management personnel. Our products may be determined to infringe another party's patent, which could lead to financial losses or adversely affect our ability to market our products. There is a risk that 1 or more of our products may be determined to infringe a patent held by another party. If this were to occur, we may be subject to an injunction or to payment of royalties, or both, which may adversely affect our ability to market the affected product or otherwise have an adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, competitors may patent technological advances that may give them a competitive advantage or create barriers to entry. We operate in an industry susceptible to significant product liability claims. Product liability claims could damage our reputation and impair our ability to market our products or obtain professional or product liability insurance, or increase the cost of such insurance. Our products are relied upon by medical personnel in connection with the treatment of patients and the collection of blood or blood comp1nts from donors. In the event that patients or donors sustain injury or death in connection with their condition or treatment, we, along with others, may be sued and whether or not we are ultimately determined to be liable, we may incur significant legal expenses. These claims may be brought by individuals seeking relief on their own behalf or purporting to represent a class. In addition, we may be subject to claims against us even if the apparent injury is due to the actions of others or the pre existing health of the patient. For example, we rely on physicians and healthcare providers to properly and correctly use our products on patients. If these physicians or healthcare providers are not properly trained, are negligent in using our products or use our products off label, the capabilities of our products may be diminished or the patient may suffer critical injury. We cannot prevent a physician from using our products for off label applications. In addition, we cannot guarantee that physicians are trained by us or their peers prior to utilizing our products. Complications resulting from the use of our products off label or use by physicians who have not been trained appropriately, or at all, may expose us to product liability claims and harm our reputation. Any such complications or adverse safety outcomes following use of VASCADE or VASCADE MVP may result in higher payments to our customers under a Performance Guarantee program applicable to those products, which would harm our business and results of operations. In addition, product liability claims may be asserted against us in the future based on events we are not aware of at the present time. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims, we may incur substantial liabilities or be required to limit or halt commercialization of our products. Even successful defense would require significant financial and management resources. Regardless of the merits or eventual outcome, such litigation could damage our reputation and, therefore, impair our ability to market our products or obtain professional or product liability insurance, or increase the cost of such insurance. While we believe that our current product liability insurance coverage is sufficient, there is no assurance that such coverage will be adequate to cover incurred liabilities or that we will be able to obtain acceptable product and professional liability coverage in the future. 28 Table of Contents General Risk Factors Our success depends on our ability to attract and retain key personnel needed to successfully operate the business. Our ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to attract and retain key employees, including people in senior management, sales, marketing and R&D positions, and to facilitate seamless leadership transitions for key positions. Our ability to recruit and retain key talent will depend on a number of factors, including hiring practices of our competitors, compensation and benefits, work location, work environment and industry economic conditions. In December 2019, we relocated our corporate headquarters to a leased office space in Boston, Massachusetts and in response to the COVID 19 pandemic, we instituted remote working practices for many of our employees. Although we believe our move to Boston and the steps we have taken to build a collaborative, performance driven culture and to maintain employee well being during COVID 19 will help us to attract and retain key talent, we face intense competition for talent in our industry, particularly as employees are increasingly able to work remotely. If we fail to attract and retain key personnel in senior management and other positions, or if our succession planning efforts are not effective, it could adversely impact our business. Our share price has been volatile and may fluctuate, and accordingly, the value of an investment in our common stock may also fluctuate. Stock markets in general and our common stock in particular have experienced significant price and trading volume volatility over recent years. The market price and trading volume of our common stock may continue to be subject to significant fluctuations due to factors described under this Item 1A. Risk Factors, as well as economic and geopolitical conditions in general and to variability in the prevailing sentiment regarding our operations or business prospects, as well as, among other things, changing investment priorities of our shareholders. Because the market price of our common stock fluctuates significantly, shareholders may not be able sell their shares at attractive prices. Share repurchase programs could affect the price of our common stock and increase volatility and may be suspended or terminated at any time, which may result in a decrease in the trading price of our common stock. We may in the future request that the Board of Directors authorize 1 or more share repurchase programs, our most recent of which expired in May 2021 Under such share repurchase programs, we are generally authorized to repurchase, from time to time, outstanding shares of common stock in accordance with applicable laws both on the open market, including under trading plans established pursuant to Rule 10b5 1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended and in privately negotiated transactions. The actual timing, number and value of shares repurchased is determined by us and depends on a number of factors, including market conditions, applicable legal requirements and compliance with the terms of loan covenants. Such share repurchase programs may be suspended, modified or discontinued at any time and we have no obligation to repurchase any amount of our common stock under the programs. Repurchases pursuant to a share repurchase program could affect our stock price and increase its volatility. The existence of a share repurchase program could also cause our stock price to be higher than it would be in the absence of such a program and could potentially reduce the market liquidity for our common stock. There can be no assurance that any share repurchases would enhance shareholder value because the market price of our common stock may decline below the levels at which we repurchased our common stock. Although our share repurchase programs are intended to enhance long term shareholder value, short term stock price fluctuations could reduce a program effectiveness.
