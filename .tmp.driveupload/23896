    "section": "Previous Work",
    "text": "Previous Work\nHistorically, researchers have provided varied perspectives on regulatory parameters, clinical efficacy, safety protocols, and ethical considerations of the FDA approval process, pondering the balance between the stringent standards of FDA against the necessity to uphold patient safety. While the rigorous processes may stifle innovation, it has essential safeguards that protect patients and ensure the quality of biomedical devices. In my project, I will navigate through these diversified viewpoints, synthesizing a cohesive understanding of the predominant factors influencing FDA decisions.\n“An Analysis of Critical Factors in Medical Device Development to Design for FDA”, a 2013 study by Lourdres A. Medina et al., focuses on exploring the pivotal factors and considerations in the medical device development phase that are critical for gaining FDA approval. The study evaluates different aspects of medical device development to identify key components and strategies that can optimize the process of achieving regulatory approval. Medina found that understanding and integrating regulatory requirements from the early development stages, stringent and well-structured clinical trials, and comprehensive documentation are paramount to both success in achieving FDA approval and expediting the approval process.1 Additionally, the authors found that procedural measures in research aimed towards ensuring safety and efficacy of devices through rigorous testing and quality assurance also significantly impacted the approval process. 2 Additionally, in his thesis “Factors Influencing FDA Clearance Time for Medical Device 510(k) Applications,” Andrew J. Koert assessed and analyzed the distinct elements and factors that influence the amount of time taken by the FDA to clear medical device 510(k) applications. The research identified several factors influencing clearance times, including the type of device, the complexity of the device, the quality of the submission, and the workload of the reviewing division within the FDA. 3"

I hypothesize that FDA approval is influenced by a multitude of factors including, but not limited to:\nClinical Trial\n\nNumber of participants\nTrial duration\nOutcome measures (e.g., efficacy, safety, adverse events)\nP-values and confidence intervals\n\nFinancial\n\nAmount of funding received for research, development, and clinical trials\nTotal Addressable Market (TAM)\nDevelopmental Timeline\n\nDuration of each development phase\nTime spent in the regulatory approval process\n\n\nCompany Experience\n\nNumber of previously approved devices by the company\nNumber of failed approval attempts\n\nDevice Features\n\nNumber of components\nDimensions and weight\nDevice Usability\n\nMarket Dynamics\n\nNumber of similar devices in the market\nMarket share of similar devices"

Performing a rigorous, data-driven analysis of these factors is essential to enhance the transparency of regulatory processes, facilitating a more straightforward path for researchers to develop for groundbreaking biomedical devices, improving the quality of patient care and furthering the bounds of the healthcare industry."
