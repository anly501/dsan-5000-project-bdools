We believe we have been able to introduce new products and capture significant market share because of our expertise in product design, our proprietary technology and our skills in injection and insert molding. Merit was organized in July 1987 as a Utah corporation. We also conduct our operations through a number of domestic and foreign subsidiaries. Our principal offices are located at 1600 West Merit Parkway, South Jordan, Utah, 84095, and our teleph1 number is (801) 253 1600. See Item 2 Properties. We maintain an Internet website at www.merit.com. 1 Table of Contents PRODUCTS We design, develop, manufacture, and market innovative products that offer a high level of quality, value, and safety to our customers, as well as the patients they serve. We have devoted our attention to four primary areas cardiology, radiology, pulmonology, and gastroenterology. Our products are also used in other clinical areas such as pain management, ear nose and throat physicians ( ENTs ), interventional nephrology, endovascular surgery, and thoracic surgery. The success of our products is enhanced by the extensive experience of our management team in the healthcare industry, our experienced direct sales force and distributors, our ability to combine and customize devices, kits, trays and procedural packs at the request of our customers, and our dedication to offering facility unique solutions in the markets we serve worldwide. Cardiology and Radiology Products Interventional cardiology and interventional radiology are specialty disciplines that use many common visualization techniques and therapeutic approaches to treat vascular disease. The common aspect of these 2 disciplines affords us the opportunity to gain product line efficiencies by serving 2 distinct therapeutic needs with very similar product platforms. We also recognize the unique aspects of the 2 disciplines and provide very specific products to serve the unique product needs of physicians practicing in the 2 disciplines. Interventional cardiology is a branch of the medical specialty of cardiology that deals specifically with the catheter based diagnosis and treatment of heart diseases. A large number of procedures that can be performed by catheterization involve the insertion of a sheath into the femoral, radial, or brachial artery. Fluoroscopy (real time moving X ray images) and computed tomography ( CT ) or 3 dimensional computer generated images are most often used to visualize the vessels and chambers of the heart during these diagnostic and interventional procedures. Percutaneous coronary interventions ( PCI ) are used to treat coronary atherosclerosis and the resulting narrowing of the arteries of the heart. In 2011, we introduced the ASAP Aspiration Catheter, a single extrusion wire braided catheter with a large aspiration lumen to facilitate quick aspiration of emboli and thrombi from tortuous anatomy. Interventional radiology is related to the minimally invasive treatment of disease in peripheral vessels and organs of the body. Percutaneous peripheral interventions ( PPI ) are used to treat peripheral vascular disease conditions outside the heart. Inflation Devices. During PCI and PPI procedures, balloons and or stents are placed within the vasculature. The balloons must be carefully placed, inflated, and deflated within the vessel in order to achieve optimal results without injury to the patient. For more than 2 decades, we have offered an extensive, innovative line of inflation devices that accurately measure pressures during balloon and stent deployment. The Blue Diamond Digital Inflation Device features a new angled gauge for better viewing. Products like our IntelliSystem and Monarch inflation systems (state of the art digital inflation systems), as well as the BasixCOMPAK Inflation Device, offer the clinician a wide range of features and prices, along with the quality and ergonomic superiority for which we are known. Hemostasis Valves. We have developed a broad line of technically sophisticated, clinically acclaimed hemostasis valves, Merit Angioplasty Packs (MAP Kits) and angioplasty accessories. Hemostasis valves connect to catheters and allow passage of additional guide wires, balloon catheters, and other devices into the vasculature while reducing the amount of blood loss during the procedures. Our hemostasis brands include Honor , AccessPLUS , Access 9 , DoublePlay , MBA and MBA Plus , and the Passage . Vascular Retrieval Devices . The EN Snare Endovascular Snare System is intended for use in the cardiovascular system or hollow viscous to retrieve and manipulate foreign objects. The EN Snare is designed with 3 interlaced loops to increase the probability of foreign body capture and is offered in seven sizes to accommodate a broad range of vessels throughout the body. Vascular Access Products. We offer a broad line of devices used to gain and maintain vascular access while protecting the clinician from accidental cuts and needle sticks during procedures. These effective and useful devices and kits include the Futura Safety Scalpel and an improved line of angiography needles (Merit Advance ), as well as the SecureLoc Introducer Needle. In addition, we offer an extensive line of sheath introducers (Prelude ) and mini access kits (MAK and S MAK ), which are designed to allow the clinician smooth, less traumatic, and convenient access to the patient vasculature. Diagnostic Catheters. We offer diagnostic catheters for use during both cardiology and radiology angiographic procedures. Our diagnostic catheter offering includes our Impress line of peripheral catheters and the Performa line of cardiology catheters. These catheters offer interventional radiologists and cardiologists superior performance during a variety of angiography procedures. 2 Table of Contents Guide Wires and Torque Devices. Our diagnostic guide wires are used to traverse vascular anatomy and aid in placing catheters and other devices.

These wires provide enhanced maneuverability through tortuous anatomy. We also offer a line of torque devices (guide wire steering tools) that can be used on both standard and hydrophilic guide wires in both large and small diameters and are often included as a comp1nt in our angioplasty packs. Angiography and Angioplasty Accessories. In 2011, we introduced the Flow Control Switch , an integrated, 1 handed, single channel switch designed with clinician and patient safety in mind. Since the introduction of the CCS , our coronary control syringe line, in 1988, we have continued to develop innovative, problem solving devices, accessories, kits and procedure trays for use during minimally invasive diagnosis and treatment of coronary artery and peripheral disease. We now offer a broad range of specialty syringes including color coded Medallion syringes, and the proprietary VacLok negative pressure syringe. The most recent line extensions to our syringe product family are frosted and sword handled Medallion syringes. Additionally, we offer an extensive line of kits containing fluid management products such as syringes, manifolds, stopcocks, tubing, and disposable pressure transducers (Meritrans ) for measurement of pressures within the vessels and chambers of the heart. The TRAM and TRAM P Integrated Transducers combine a low torque manifold with the transducer. We also provide devices, kits, and procedure trays used to effectively and safely manage fluids, contrast media, and waste during angiography and interventional procedures. The Miser II contrast management system complements our comprehensive line of fluid management products used in angiography procedures. Safety and Waste Management Systems. We offer a variety of safety related products and kits. Our ShortStop and ShortStop Advantage temporary sharps holders address the potential safety issues associated with accidental needle sticks. Our extensive line of color coded Medallion Specialty Syringes and the PAL pen and label medication labeling system (which complies with the latest patient safety initiatives of The Joint Commission (formerly known as JCAHO ) are designed to help minimize mix ups in administering medication. We also offer waste management products to help avoid accidental exposure to contaminated fluids. These include our Occupational Safety and Health Administration ( OSHA ) compliant waste disposal basins the BackStop , BackStop+ , MiniStop , MiniStop+ , and DugOut . These products have been designed to complement other Merit devices and are included in many of our kits and procedure trays in order to make the clinical setting safer for both clinicians and the patients. Radial Artery Compression Devices. In recent years, radial artery catheterization has become increasingly popular as an alternative to femoral artery access when performing diagnostic and interventional cardiology procedures. We have developed and now offer 2 independent, highly differentiated radial compression systems, including the Finale and the RADStat . Drainage Catheters and Accessories. We have a broad line of catheters for nephrostomy, abscess, and other drainage procedures. Our ReSolve non locking and locking drainage catheter line has been expanded every year since the product family was introduced in 2006. These catheters unique, convenient locking mechanisms are appreciated by clinicians and patients who often comment on the enhanced comfort that the catheter provides them. We also offer a range of catheter fixation devices including the Revolution Catheter Securement Device which was designed to be cost effective, to save time, and to enhance patient comfort. We also provide a wide selection of accessories that complement our drainage catheters, including tubing sets and drainage bags. For non vascular applications, we offer mini access kits (MAK NV ) designed for easy visualization and quick access into the drainage area. For enhanced visibility, the device features an echo enhanced needle and radiopaque marker tip on the introducer. Paracentesis, Thoracentesis and Pericardiocentesis Catheters. Paracentesis is a procedure to remove fluid that has accumulated in the abdominal cavity (perit1al fluid). Our 1 Step Centesis Catheter, Safety Paracentesis Procedure Tray ( SPPT ) and Thoracentesis and Paracentesis Set ( TAPS ) are designed to provide clinicians with a safe, convenient, and cost effective method for removing this fluid accumulation. Thoracentesis is a procedure to remove fluid that has accumulated in the pleural space. Our 1 Step product line includes a valved version of the device. The valved 1 Step Centesis Catheter and TAPS may also be used to remove the excess fluid in the pleural space during a thoracentesis. Pericardiocentesis is a procedure in which fluid is aspirated from the pericardial sac (the sac enveloping the heart). Our pericardiocentesis kit is designed as an organized, ready to use, convenient tray to assist the clinician in draining fluid quickly from the pericardial sac. Therapeutic Infusion Catheters. We offer an extensive line of therapeutic thrombolytic infusion systems featuring the Fountain Infusion System and the Mistique Infusion Catheter. These technically advanced catheters are used to treat thrombus (blood clot) formation in the peripheral vessels of the body, including native dialysis fistula and synthetic grafts. Embolic Microspheres. In September 2010 we acquired BioSphere Medical, Inc. ( BioSphere ) in a merger transaction. With the acquisition of BioSphere, we now offer embolic microspheres and microsphere delivery systems. Microspheres are precisely calibrated, spherical, hydrophilic, microporous beads made with acrylic copolymer cross linked with gelatin. We also 3 Table of Contents offer microcatheters and small ( mini ) guide wires which are used as delivery systems for the embolic particles. These products include the following Embosphere Microspheres and EmboGold Microspheres, which are marketed for symptomatic uterine fibroids, hypervascularized tumors and arteriovenous malformations in the United States, The European Union and several other markets outside the United States; HepaSphere Microspheres, which are marketed in the European Union, Brazil, and Russia for primary and metastatic liver cancer, and in the European Union and Russia for drug delivery in the treatment of primary and metastatic liver cancer; and QuadraSphere Microspheres, which are marketed for the treatment of hypervascularized tumors and arteriovenous malformations in the United States. Multipurpose Microcatheters. With our acquisition of BioSphere, we expanded our multi purpose microcatheter offering to include the EmboCath Plus for the controlled and selected infusion of diagnostic media or the delivery of interventional devices or therapeutic pharmaceuticals into selected blood vessels. These specialty catheters are used to deliver various embolic agents, including microspheres, alcohol, metallic coils, poly vinyl alcohol particles, and gel foam that can block blood vessels (e.g., for the purpose of stopping bleeding) to tissues or organs including uterine artery embolization for percutaneous (through the skin) treatment of uterine fibroids. Dialysis and Interventional Nephrology. In 2011, we added the Centros and the CentrosFLO split tipped dialysis catheters to our chronic dialysis line. The ProGuide is considered a workhorse catheter for chronic dialysis and provides a platform for additional Merit products in the dialysis and interventional nephrology market. For example, the new Prelude Short Sheath provides vascular access to dialysis grafts, along with our extensive line of micro access devices such as the MAK and S MAK line of mini access kits. We also offer a wide range of guide wires, diagnostic catheters, therapeutic infusion systems, and safety products that can be used during dialysis related procedures. The OuTake Catheter Extractor is used to remove tunneled chronic dialysis catheters from dialysis patients. A curved introducer needle aids clinicians who choose to place a tunneled dialysis catheter over a wire with a single stick. The Slip Not Suture Retention Device provides a unique and effective method for securing a purse string suture that controls bleeding after an arteriovenous ( AV ) fistula intervention. In addition, we offer the Impress 30 cm angiographic catheters which can be used by interventional nephrologists. Our dialysis and interventional nephrology products are designed to provide comprehensive coverage for completing AV fistula interventions. Interventional Gastroenterology and Pulmonology Products Airway Stents. Through our Merit Endotek division, we sell a variety of non vascular stents.

We offer a variety of devices and accessories used during these procedures. Discography Products. Discography is a technique used to determine whether a disc is the source of pain in patients with back or neck pain. During discography, contrast medium is injected into the disc and the patient response to the injection is noted. Due to their quality and accuracy, our digital inflation devices (IntelliSystem and Monarch ) are used in many pain management clinics. Pressure Sensors . Our sensor division manufactures and sells microelectromechanical systems ( MEMS ) pressure sensor comp1nts focusing on piezoresistive pressure sensors in various forms, including bare silicon die, die mounted on ceramic substrates, and custom assemblies for specific customers. MARKETING AND SALES Target Market Industry. Our target markets include diagnostic and interventional cardiology, interventional radiology, interventional gastroenterology, interventional pulmonology, ENT, vascular surgery, interventional nephrology, pain management, and thoracic surgery. According to government statistics, cardiovascular disease continues to be a leading cause of death and a significant health problem in the United States. Treatment options range from dietary changes to surgery, depending on the nature of the specific disease or disorder. Endovascular techniques, including angioplasty, stenting, and endoluminal stent grafts, continue to represent important therapeutic options for the treatment of vascular disease. We derive a large percentage of our revenues from sales of products used during percutaneous diagnostic and interventional procedures such as angiography, angioplasty, and stent placement and we intend to pursue additional sales growth by building on our existing market position in both catheter technology and accessory products. In addition to products used in the treatment of coronary and peripheral vascular disease, we continue our efforts to develop and distribute other devices used in the major markets we serve. For example, we have developed and are distributing products used for percutaneous drainage. Prior to the widespread use of CT or ultrasound imaging, surgery was necessary to drain internal fluid from body cavities and organs. Currently, percutaneous drainage is frequently prescribed as the treatment of choice for many types of fluid collections. Our family of drainage catheters and associated devices are used by physicians in the interventional radiology, vascular surgery and the cardiology catheter lab for the percutaneous drainage collection of simple serous fluid to viscous fluid (blood, or infected secretion) within the body. As part of our embolic microsphere sales and marketing efforts, we attend major medical conventions throughout the world pertaining to our targeted markets and invest in market development (including physician training), practice building, referral ne2rk education and patient outreach. We work closely with major interventional radiology centers in the areas of training, therapy awareness programs, clinical studies and ongoing research. We also service the growing interventional nephrology market. Dialysis, or cleaning of the blood, is necessary in conditions such as acute renal failure, chronic renal failure and end stage renal disease, or ESRD. The kidneys remove excess water and chemical wastes from blood, permitting clean blood to return to the circulatory system. When the kidneys malfunction, waste substances are not properly excreted, creating an abnormal buildup of wastes in the bloodstream. Dialysis machines are used to treat this condition. Dialysis catheters, which connect the patient to the dialysis machine, are used at various stages in the treatment of dialysis patients. In the past few years, we have added catheters and other accessories to our dialysis related product offering. 5 Table of Contents We believe our recently created Endotek division and the move into the areas of interventional gastroenterology, pulmonology, ENT, and thoracic surgery will open up new opportunities to sell, not only existing Merit products, such as inflation devices, syringes, centesis catheters and procedure kits to those markets, but also to provide additional offerings built upon our non vascular stent and guide wire technology. In general, our target markets are characterized by rapid change resulting from technological advances and scientific discoveries. We plan to continue to develop and launch innovative products to support clinical trends and to address the increasing demands of these markets. Market Strategy. Our marketing strategy is focused on identifying and introducing a regular flow of highly profitable differentiated products that meet customer needs. In order to stay abreast of customer needs, we seek suggestions from hospital personnel working with our products in cardiology and radiology applications, as well as gastroenterology, pulmonology and thoracic surgery. Suggestions for new products and product improvements may come from engineers, sales people, physicians and technicians who perform the clinical procedures. When we determine that a product suggestion demonstrates a sustainable competitive advantage, meets customer needs, fits strategically and technologically with our business, and has a good potential financial return, we generally assemble a project team comprised of individuals from our sales, marketing, engineering, manufacturing, legal, and quality assurance departments. This team works to identify the customer requirements, integrate the design, compile necessary documentation and testing, and prepare the product for market introduction. We believe that 1 of our marketing strengths is our capacity to rapidly conceive, design, develop, and introduce new products. U.S. and International Sales. Sales of our products in the United States accounted for 65%, 68% and 66% of our total sales for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Our direct sales force currently consists of an Executive Vice President of Marketing and Sales, a Vice President of U. S. Sales, 12 regional sales managers and 87 direct sales representatives and clinical specialists located in major metropolitan areas throughout the United States. To support our U.S. direct sales team we have developed a national account department that includes a Vice President of National Accounts, field based Health System Account Directors and contract administrators. In addition, our Merit Endotek division maintains a separate worldwide sales force consisting of a division President, Vice President of Sales, Vice President of Marketing, 3 regional sales managers, and 15 direct sales representatives. Approximately 400 independent dealer organizations and custom procedure tray manufacturers distribute our products worldwide, including territories in Europe, Africa, the Middle East, Asia, South and Central America, Australia and Canada.

We employ approximately 30 individuals who support the distribution and sale of our products in China. In 2011, our international sales grew approximately 32% over our 2010 international sales, and accounted for approximately $125.9 million or 35% of our total sales. Our new Merit Endotek division has a small, but growing, presence in international markets. With the recent and planned additions to our product lines, we believe that our international sales will continue to increase. We require our international dealers to inventory products and sell directly to customers within defined sales territories. Each of our products must be approved for sale under the laws of the country in which it is sold. International dealers are responsible for compliance with all applicable laws and regulations in their respective countries. We consider training to be a critical factor in the success of our direct sales force. Our sales representatives are trained by our personnel at our facilities, by a senior sales person in their respective territories, at regular national and regional sales meetings, by consulting cardiologists, radiologists, endoscopists, and thoracic surgeons and by observation of procedures in laboratories and operating rooms throughout the U.S. OEM Sales. Our worldwide OEM division sells molded comp1nts, sub assembled goods, custom kits, and bulk non sterile goods which may be combined with other comp1nts and or goods from other companies and then sold under a Merit or third party label. Our OEM division consists of an Executive President of Global OEM, a Vice President of OEM Sales, a staff of regional sales representatives based in the US and Europe, and a dedicated OEM Engineering and Customer Service Group. 6 Table of Contents CUSTOMERS We provide products to hospitals and clinic based cardiologists, radiologists, anesthesiologists, physiatrists (pain management physicians), neurologists, nephrologists, vascular surgeons, interventional gastroenterologists and pulmonologists, thoracic surgeons, technicians and nurses. Hospitals and acute care facilities in the United States purchase our products through our direct sales forces, distributors, OEM partners, and custom procedure tray manufacturers who assemble and combine our products in custom kits and packs. Outside the United States, hospitals and acute care facilities purchase our products through our direct sales force, or, in the absence of a sales force, through independent distributors or OEM partners. In 2011, our U.S. sales force made approximately 45% of our sales directly to U.S. hospitals (including 3% for our Merit Endotek division) and approximately 11% of our sales through other channels such as U.S. custom procedure tray manufacturers and distributors. We also sell products to other medical device companies through our U.S. OEM sales force, which accounted for approximately 9% of our 2011 sales. Approximately 35% of our 2011 sales were made to international markets by our direct European sales force, international distributors, and our OEM sales force (includes 3% for OEM international). Sales to our largest customer accounted for approximately four percent of total sales during the year ended December 31, 2011 RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT We remain committed to new product development by advancing leadership in all of our market segments. In 2011, we launched the ASAP Aspiration Catheter in the United States which addresses a clinical need in cardiology for improved clot extraction. We also released the Blue Diamond Inflation Device for cardiology and radiology with an enhanced visual display and more information for clinicians performing angioplasty procedures. Inflation devices remain an important area in which we continue to innovate for our customers. We also launched the Big60 Inflation Device for our Merit Endotek division which has a larger volume to facilitate stenting in the gastrointestinal and airway tracts. We anticipate that our research and development growth will continue into 2012 with the initiation of additional projects. Our research and development expenses were approximately $219 million, $15.3 million, and $112 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Our research and development activities continue to be fueled with multiple product ideas guided by our Chief Executive Officer, our Vice President of Research and Development and our sales and marketing teams, as well as by collaboration with physicians with whom we have long term relationships. We have research and development facilities in South Jordan, Utah; Angleton and Dallas, Texas; Jackson Township, New Jersey; Galway, Ireland; Paris, France and Venlo, The Netherlands. During the year ended December 31, 2011, we entered into several asset acquisitions related to research and development projects, which resulted in aggregate expenses of approximately $4.9 million. Since technological feasibility of the underlying research and development projects had not been reached as of December 31, 2011 and such technology had no future alternative to us as of that date, the charge of approximately $4.9 million has been included in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2011 We may enter into additional acquisition transactions in future periods. MANUFACTURING We manufacture many of our products utilizing our proprietary technology and our expertise in plastic injection and insert molding. We generally contract with third parties for the tooling of our molds, but we design and own most of our molds. We utilize our experience in injection and insert molding technologies in the manufacture of most of the custom comp1nts used in our products. We have received I nternational Standards Organization ( ISO ) 134852003 certification for our facilities in Utah, Texas, Virginia, Massachusetts, Ireland and France. We have also received ISO 90012008 certification for our Merit Sensor Systems facility in South Jordan, Utah. We either assemble the electronic monitors and sensors used in our IntelliSystem and Monarch inflation devices from standard electronic comp1nts or we purchase them from third party suppliers. Merit Sensor Systems, Inc., our wholly owned subsidiary ( Merit Sensors ), develops and markets silicon pressure sensors. Merit Sensors presently supplies all of the sensors we utilize in our digital inflation devices. We currently produce and package all of our microspheres. Manufacturing of our microsphere products includes the synthesis and processing of raw materials and third party manufactured compounds. Our products are manufactured at several factories, including facilities located in South Jordan, West Jordan and Murray, Utah; Galway, Ireland; Venlo, The Netherlands; Paris, France; Angleton, Texas; and Chester, Virginia. See Item 2 Properties. We have also contracted with a third party manufacturer to produce some of our products at a contract manufacturing facility in 7 Table of Contents Mexico. We have distribution centers located in South Jordan, Utah; Angleton, Texas; Chester, Virginia; Beijing, China; Hong Kong and Maastricht, The Netherlands. We believe that our variety of suppliers for raw materials and comp1nts necessary for the manufacture of our products, as well as our long term relationships with such suppliers, promote stability in our manufacturing processes. Historically, we have not been materially affected by interruptions with such suppliers. Furthermore, we seek to develop relationships with potential back up suppliers for materials and comp1nts in the event of supply interruptions. COMPETITION We compete in several global markets, including diagnostic and interventional cardiology, interventional radiology, vascular surgery, interventional nephrology, cardiothoracic surgery, interventional gastroenterology and pulmonology, anesthesiology and pain management. These markets encompass a large number of suppliers of varying sizes. In the interventional cardiology and radiology markets, as well as the gastroenterology and pulmonology markets, we compete with large international, multi divisional medical supply companies such as Cordis Corporation (Johnson & Johnson), Boston Scientific Corporation, Medtronic, C.R. Bard, Abbott Laboratories, Teleflex, Cook Incorporated, and Terumo Corporation. Medium size companies we compete with include AngioDynamics, Vascular Solutions, B. Braun, Olympus, Navilyst Medical, Edwards Lifesciences, and ICU Medical. Our primary competitive embolotherapy product has been non spherical polyvinyl alcohol (or PVA ) particles, a product introduced into the market more than 20 years ago. Currently, the primary products with which our microspheres compete are spherical PVA, sold by Boston Scientific Corporation, BTG and Terumo Corporation; Embozene, sold by CeloNova Biosciences, Inc.; gel foam, sold by Pfizer Inc.; and non spherical (particle) PVA, sold by Boston Scientific and Cook Incorporated. Our principal competitors in uterine fibroid embolization ( UFE ) are BTG, Boston Scientific, Cook, Cordis Corporation (Johnson & Johnson), Pfizer and Terumo, as well as companies selling or developing non embolotherapy solutions for UFE. The principal competitive factors in the markets in which our products are sold are quality, price, value, device feature, customer service, breadth of line, and customer relationships. We believe our products have achieved market acceptance due to the quality of materials and workmanship of our products, their innovative design, our willingness to customize our products to fit customer needs, and our prompt attention to customer requests. Our products are priced competitively, but generally not below prices for competing products. 1 of our primary competitive strengths is our relative stability in the marketplace; a comprehensive, broad line of ancillary products; and our history of introducing a variety of new products and product line extensions to the market on a regular basis. Based on available industry data, with respect to the number of procedures performed, we believe we are the leading provider of digital inflation technology in the world. In addition, we believe we are 1 of the market leaders in the United States for inflation devices, hemostasis devices and torque devices. We believe we are 1 of 2 market leaders in the United States for control syringes, waste disposal systems, tubing, and manifold kits . We anticipate the recent and planned additions to our product lines will enable us to compete even more effectively in both the U.S. and international markets. There is no assurance that we will be able to maintain our existing competitive advantages or compete successfully in the future. Within the field of uterine artery embolization, we believe we are the market share leader and 1 of only 3 companies in the United States to have embolic products specifically indicated for use in UFE. Based on both research and clinical studies conducted on our product for UFE, we believe we offer physicians a high degree of consistent and predictable product performance, ease of use, targeted delivery, and durable vessel occlusion, and therefore satisfactory short and long term clinical outcomes validated by peer reviewed publications, when compared to our competitors. We derive a substantial majority of our revenues from sales of products used in diagnostic angiography and interventional cardiology and radiology procedures. Medical professionals are starting to use new interventional procedures and devices, as well as drugs for the treatment and prevention of cardiovascular disease. These new methods, procedures and devices may render some of our products obsolete or limit the markets for our products. However, with the advent of vascular stents and other procedures, we have experienced continued growth in sales of our products. 8 Table of Contents PROPRIETARY RIGHTS AND PATENT LITIGATION We have a number of U.S. and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications, including patents and rights to patent applications acquired through strategic transactions, which relate to various aspects of our products and technology.

M1tary judgments, remedies or restitution are often not determined until the conclusion of trial court proceedings, which can be modified on appeal, and are difficult to predict or quantify. While our pending litigation is in its preliminary stages and it is not possible to assess damages or predict an outcome, an adverse outcome could limit our ability to sell certain products or reduce our operating margin on the sale of these products and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity. We have established defenses and intend to vigorously defend our position. REGULATION FDA Regulation. The FDA and other federal, state and local authorities regulate our products and product related activities. Pursuant to the U.S. Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act ( FDCA ) and the regulations promulgated under that act, the FDA regulates the design, development, clinical trials, testing, manufacture, packaging, labeling, storage, distribution and promotion of medical devices. We believe that our products and procedures are in material compliance with all applicable FDA regulations, but the regulations regarding the manufacture and sale of our products are subject to change. We cannot predict the effect, if any, that these changes might have on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, if the FDA believes that we are not in compliance with the FDCA, it can institute proceedings to detain or seize products, require a recall, enjoin future violations and or seek civil and criminal penalties against us and our officers and employees. If we fail to comply with these regulatory requirements, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed. FDA Premarket Review. Subject to certain specific exemptions issued by the FDA, we cannot introduce a new medical device into the market until we obtain market clearance through a 510(k) premarket notification or approval through a pre market approval ( PMA ) application. The FDA 510(k) clearance procedure is less rigorous than the PMA approval procedure, but is available only to sponsors who can establish that their device is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed predicate device that was either on the market prior to the enactment of the Medical Devices Amendments of 1976 or has been cleared through the 510(k) procedure. 510(k) clearance usually takes between 3 months and 1 year from the date a 510(k) notification is submitted, but it may take longer. The FDA may find that substantial equivalence has not been shown and, as a result, require additional clinical or non clinical testing to support a 510(k) or require a PMA application. PMA applications must be supported by valid scientific evidence to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the subject device. Such evidence typically includes the results of human clinical trials, bench tests and laboratory and animal studies. The PMA application must also contain a complete description of the device and its comp1nts, and a detailed description of the manufacturing process and controls for the device. As part of the PMA application review, the FDA will inspect the manufacturer facilities for compliance with the FDA Quality System Regulations ( QSR ). If the FDA approves the PMA, it may place restrictions on the device. If the FDA evaluation of the PMA application or the manufacturing facility is not favorable, the FDA may deny approval of the PMA application or issue a not approvable letter. The FDA may also require additional clinical trials, which can delay the PMA approval process by several years. The PMA application process can be expensive and generally takes 9 Table of Contents several years to complete. After the PMA is approved, if significant changes are made to a device, its manufacturing or labeling, a PMA supplement containing additional information must be filed for prior FDA approval. If human clinical trials of a medical device are required for FDA clearance or approval and the device presents a significant risk, the sponsor of the trial must file an investigational device exemption ( IDE ) application with the FDA prior to commencing human clinical trials. The IDE application must be supported by data, typically including the results of animal and or laboratory testing. If the IDE application is approved by the FDA and 1 or more institutional review boards ( IRBs ), human clinical trials may begin at a specific number of institutional investigational sites with the specific number of patients approved by the FDA. If the device presents a non significant risk to the patient, a sponsor may begin the clinical trial after obtaining approval for the trial by 1 or more IRBs without separate approval from the FDA. Submission of an IDE application does not give assurance that the FDA will issue the IDE. If the IDE application is approved, there can be no assurance the FDA will determine that the data derived from the trials support the safety and effectiveness of the device or warrant the continuation of clinical trials. An IDE supplement must be submitted to and approved by the FDA before a sponsor or investigator may make a change to the investigational plan in such a way that may affect its scientific soundness, study indication or the rights, safety or welfare of human subjects. The trial must also comply with the FDA regulations, including the requirement that informed consent be obtained from each subject. The FDA clearance and approval processes for medical devices are expensive, uncertain and lengthy. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain necessary regulatory clearances or approvals for any product on a timely basis or at all. Delays in receipt of or failure to receive such clearances or approvals, the loss of previously received clearances or approvals, or the failure to comply with existing or future regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In October 2009, BioSphere submitted to the FDA an IDE seeking to commence a clinical trial to compare the effectiveness of QuadraSphere Microspheres. On November 29, 2010, the FDA approved a phase 3 clinical trial protocol to treat primary liver cancer with QuadraSphere Microspheres combined with the chemotherapeutic agent doxorubicin compared to conventional transarterial chemoembolization, or cTACE, with doxorubicin. Enrollment has begun both in Europe and in the United States. Our inability to complete this trial or unfavorable or inconsistent data from this trial may adversely affect our ability to obtain approval for this new indication. Changes in Cleared or Approved Devices. We must obtain new FDA 510(k) clearance or supplemental premarket approval when there is a major change or modification in the intended use or indications for use of a legally marketed device or a change or modification of the device, including certain manufacturing changes, product enhancements and product line extensions of a legally marketed device, as required by FDA regulations. In some cases, supporting clinical data may be required. The FDA may determine that a new or modified device is not substantially equivalent to a predicate device or may require that additional information, including clinical data, be submitted before a determination is made, either of which could significantly delay the introduction of new or modified device products. Current Good Manufacturing Practice Quality System Regulation and Reporting. The FDCA requires us to comply with the Quality System Regulation ( QSR ) and Good Manufacturing Practice ( GMP ) requirements pertaining to all aspects of our product design and manufacturing processes, including requirements for packaging, labeling and record keeping, complaint handling, corrective and preventive actions and internal auditing. The FDA enforces these requirements through periodic inspections of medical device manufacturers. In addition, the Medical Device Reporting ( MDR ) regulation requires us to inform the FDA whenever information reasonably suggests that 1 of our devices may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or when 1 of our devices has malfuncti1d, if the device would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or a serious injury in the event the malfunction were to recur. Labeling and Promotion . Labeling and promotional activities are also subject to scrutiny by the FDA. Labeling includes not only the label on a device, but also includes any descriptive or informational literature that accompanies or is used to promote the device. Among other things, labeling violates the law if it is false or misleading in any respect or it fails to contain adequate directions for use. Moreover, product claims that are outside the labeling either approved or cleared by the FDA violate the FDCA. Allegations of off label promotion can result in enforcement action by both federal and state agencies, including the FDA, the Department of Justice, the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, state attorneys general, as well as liability under the False Claims Act, discussed further below. Federal Trade Commission. Our product promotion is also subject to regulation by the Federal Trade Commission (the FTC ), which has primary oversight of the advertising of unrestricted devices. The Federal Trade Commission Act prohibits unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce, as well as unfair or deceptive practices such as the dissemination of any false advertisement pertaining to medical devices. FTC enforcement can result in orders requiring, among other things, limits on advertising, corrective advertising, consumer redress, rescission of contracts and such 10 Table of Contents other relief as may be deemed necessary. Import Requirements. To import a device, the importer must file an entry notice and bond with the United States Bureau of Customs and Border Protection ( CBP ). All devices are subject to FDA examination before release from the CBP. Any article that appears to be in violation of the FDCA may be refused admission and a notice of detention and hearing may be issued. If the FDA ultimately refuses admission, CBP may issue a notice for redelivery and assess liquidated damages for up to 3 times the value of the lot. Export Requirements. Products for export from Europe and from the United States are subject to foreign countries import requirements and the exporting requirements of the FDA or European regulating bodies, as applicable. In particular, international sales of medical devices manufactured in the United States that are not approved or cleared by the FDA for use in the United States, or are banned or deviate from lawful performance standards, are subject to FDA export requirements. Foreign countries often require, among other things, an FDA certificate for products for export, also called a Certificate for Foreign Government. To obtain this certificate from the FDA, the device manufacturer must apply to the FDA. The FDA certifies that the product has been granted clearance or approval in the United States and that the manufacturing facilities were in compliance with Quality Systems Regulation regulations at the time of the last FDA inspection. Foreign Regulations. Medical device laws and regulations are also in effect in many countries outside of the United States. These laws and regulations vary significantly from country to country and range from comprehensive device approval requirements for some or all of our medical device products to more basic requests for product data or certification. The number and scope of these requirements are increasing. In particular, marketing of medical devices in the European Economic Area ( EEA ) is subject to compliance with European Medical Device Directives. Under this regime, a medical device may be placed on the market within the EEA if it conforms to certain essential requirements and bears the European Conformity ( CE ) mark. The most fundamental essential requirement is that a medical device must be designed and manufactured in such a way that it will not compromise the clinical condition or safety of patients, or the safety and health of users and others. In addition, the device must achieve the performances intended by the manufacturer and be designed, manufactured and packaged in a suitable manner. Manufacturers must demonstrate that their devices conform to the relevant essential requirements through a conformity assessment procedure. The nature of the assessment depends upon the classification of the device. The classification rules are mainly based on 3 criteria the length of time the device is in contact with the body, the degree of invasiveness and the extent to which the device affects the anatomy. Conformity assessment procedures for all but the lowest risk classification of device involve a notified body. Notified bodies are often private entities and are authorized or licensed to perform such assessments by government authorities. Manufacturers usually have some flexibility to select conformity assessment procedures for a particular class of device and to reflect their circumstances, e.g., the likelihood that the manufacturer will make frequent modifications to its products. Conformity assessment procedures require an assessment of available clinical evidence, literature data for the product and post market experience in respect of similar products already marketed. Notified bodies also may review the manufacturer quality systems. If satisfied that the product conforms to the relevant essential requirements, the notified body issues a certificate of conformity, which the manufacturer uses as a basis for its own declaration of conformity and application of the CE mark. Application of the CE mark allows the product to be distributed throughout the EEA. Failure to materially comply with applicable EEA and other foreign medical device laws and regulations would likely have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, the European Commission is currently considering revising the legal framework for medical evidence in the EEA and has announced its intention to proposed new legislation during the course of 2012 If the current EEA and other foreign regulations regarding the manufacture and sale of medical devices change, the new regulations may impose additional obligations on medical device manufactures or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business. Reimbursement. Our products are used in medical procedures generally covered by government or private health plans. In general, a third party payer covers a medical device or procedure only when the plan administrator is satisfied that the product or procedure is reasonable and necessary to the treatment of the patient. Some private payers in the U.S. and government payers in foreign countries may also condition payment on the cost effectiveness of the treatment. Even if a device has received clearance or approval for marketing by the FDA, there is no certainty that third party payers will reimburse patients for the cost of the device and related procedures. Even if coverage is available, third party payers may place restrictions on the circumstances in which they provide coverage or may offer reimbursement that is not sufficient to cover the cost of our products. If hospitals and physicians cannot obtain adequate reimbursement for our products or the procedures in which they are used, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could suffer a material adverse impact. 11 Table of Contents Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. In March 2010, the U.S. Congress enacted legislation known as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ( PPACA ), which we anticipate will substantially change the way that health care in the United States is financed by both governmental and private insurers and will significantly affect the medical device industry. This new law contains a number of provisions, including provisions governing enrollment in federal health care programs, reimbursement changes, the increased use of comparative effectiveness research in health care decision making, and enhancements to fraud and abuse requirements and enforcement, that will affect existing government health care programs and will result in the development of new programs. A number of provisions contained in the PPACA may adversely affect our net revenue for our marketed products and any future products. The new legislation, among other things, subjects most medical devices to a 23% excise tax, beginning January 1, 2013, which may have a material effect on our results of operations and financial condition. The PPACA also includes new reporting and disclosure requirements for device manufacturers with regard to payments or other transfers of value made to health care providers. Reporting under these provisions is scheduled to commence in March 2013, and the first report will relate to payments or other transfers of value made in 2012 Reports submitted under these new requirements will be placed in a public database. If we fail to provide these reports, or if the reports we provide are not accurate, we could be subject to significant penalties. In addition, developing the necessary systems to comply with the new reporting requirement could be financially burdensome. Anti Kickback Statutes. The Medicare and Medicaid Patient Protection Act of 1987, as amended, which is more commonly known as the federal health care Anti Kickback Statute, prohibits persons from, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, to a person to induce the purchase, order, lease, or recommendation of a good or service for which payment may be made in whole or part under a federal health care program such as Medicare or Medicaid. The definition of remuneration has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including, for example, gifts, discounts, the furnishing of supplies or equipment, credit arrangements, payments of cash and waivers of payments. Several courts have interpreted the statute intended requirement to mean that if any 1 purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals or otherwise generate business involving goods or services reimbursed in whole or in part under federal health care programs, the statute has been violated. Certain exceptions, including payments to bona fide employees, certain discounts and certain payments to group purchasing organizations, are provided in the statute and or have been promulgated through regulation. Violations can result in significant penalties, imprisonment and exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid and other federal health care programs. Exclusion of a manufacturer would preclude any federal health care program from paying for its products. In addition, kickback arrangements can provide the basis for an action under the Federal False Claims Act, which is discussed in more detail below. Recognizing that the Anti Kickback Statute is broad and may technically prohibit many innocuous or beneficial arrangements, the Office of Inspector General of Health and Human Services ( OIG ) issued a series of regulations, generally known as safe harbors. These safe harbors set forth provisions that, if all the applicable requirements are met, will ensure that health care providers and other parties will not be prosecuted under the Anti Kickback Statute. The failure of a transaction or arrangement to fit precisely within 1 or more safe harbors does not necessarily mean that it is illegal or that prosecution will be pursued. However, conduct and business arrangements that do not fully satisfy an applicable safe harbor may result in increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities such as the OIG. Arrangements that implicate the Anti Kickback Statute, and that do not fall within a safe harbor, are analyzed by the OIG on a case by case basis. Government officials have focused recent enforcement efforts on the sales and marketing activities of pharmaceutical, medical device, and other health care companies, and recently have brought cases against individuals or entities that allegedly offered unlawful inducements to potential or existing customers in an attempt to procure their business. Settlements of these cases by health care companies have involved significant fines and or penalties and in some instances criminal pleas. In addition to the Federal Anti Kickback Statute, many states have their own anti kickback laws. Often, these laws closely follow the language of the federal law, although they do not always have the same exceptions or safe harbors. In some states, these anti kickback laws apply with respect to all payers, including commercial health insurance companies. False Claims Laws. Federal false claims laws prohibit any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to get a false claim paid. Manufacturers can be held liable under false claims laws, even if they do not submit claims to the government, if they are found to have caused submission of false claims. The Federal Civil False Claims Act also includes whistle blower provisions that allow private citizens to bring suit against an entity or individual on behalf of the United States and to recover a portion of any m1tary recovery. Many of the recent highly publicized settlements in the health care industry relating to sales and marketing practices have been cases brought under the False Claims Act. The majority of states also have adopted statutes or regulations similar to the federal false claims laws, which apply to Item and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state 12 Table of Contents programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payer. Sanctions under these federal and state laws may include civil m1tary penalties, exclusion of a manufacturer products from reimbursement under government programs, criminal fines and imprisonment. Privacy and Security. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 ( HIPAA ), the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (the HITECH Act ), and the rules promulgated thereunder, require certain entities, referred to as covered entities (including most health care providers and health plans), to comply with established standards, including standards regarding the privacy and security of protected health information ( PHI ). HIPAA further requires that covered entities enter into agreements meeting certain regulatory requirements with their business associates, as such term is defined by HIPAA, which, among other things, obligate the business associates to safeguard the covered entity PHI against improper use and disclosure. In addition, a business associate may face significant statutory and contractual liability if the business associate breaches the agreement or causes the covered entity to fail to comply with HIPAA. In the course of our business operations, we have entered into several business associate agreements with certain of our customers that are covered entities. Pursuant to the terms of these business associate agreements, we have agreed, among other things, not to use or further disclose the covered entity PHI except as permitted or required by the agreements or as required by law, to use reasonable administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to prevent prohibited disclosure of such PHI and to report to the covered entity any unauthorized uses or disclosures of such PHI. Accordingly, we incur compliance related costs in meeting HIPAA related obligations under business associate agreements to which we are a party. Moreover, if we fail to meet our contractual obligations under such agreements, we may incur significant liability. In addition, HIPAA criminal provisions potentially could be applied to a non covered entity that aided and abetted the violation of, or conspired to violate, HIPAA, although we are unable at this time to determine conclusively whether our actions could be subject to prosecution in the event of an impermissible disclosure of health information to us. Also, many state laws regulate the use and disclosure of health information. Those state laws that are more protective of individually identifiable health information are not preempted by HIPAA. Finally, in the event we change our business model and become a HIPAA covered entity, we would be directly subject to HIPAA, its rules and its civil and criminal penalties. Environmental Regulations. We are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, as well as public and worker health and safety. In the course of our business, we are involved in the handling, storage and disposal of certain chemicals. The laws and regulations applicable to our operations include provisions that regulate the release or discharge of hazardous or other regulated materials into the environment. Usually these environmental laws and regulations impose strict liability, rendering a person liable without regard to negligence or fault on the part of such person. Such environmental laws and regulations may expose us to liability for the conduct of, or conditions caused by, others, or for acts that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time the acts were performed. To date, we have not been required to expend material amounts in connection with our efforts to comply with environmental requirements and currently do not believe that compliance with such requirements will have a material adverse effect upon our capital expenditures, results of operations or competitive position in the future. Failure to comply with applicable environmental and related laws could have a material adverse effect on our business. Our operations are also subject to various laws and regulations relating to occupational health and safety. We maintain safety, training and maintenance programs as part of our ongoing efforts to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Compliance with applicable health and safety laws and regulations has required and continues to require substantial expenditures. Environmental, health and safety legislation and regulations change frequently. EMPLOYEES As of December 31, 2011, we employed 2,400 people.

Item 1A. Risk Factors. Our business, operations and financial condition are subject to certain risks and uncertainties. Should 1 or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should any underlying assumptions prove incorrect, our actual results will vary, and may vary materially, from those anticipated, estimated, projected or expected. Among the key factors that may have a direct bearing on our business, operations or financial condition are the factors identified below A significant adverse change in, or failure to comply with, governing regulations could adversely affect our business, operations or financial condition. Substantially all of our products are devices, as defined in the FDCA, and the manufacture, distribution, record keeping, labeling and advertisement of substantially all of our products are subject to regulation by the FDA in the United States and equivalent regulatory agencies in various foreign countries in which our products are manufactured, distributed, labeled, offered or sold. Further, we are subject to regular review and periodic inspections at our facilities with respect to compliance with the FDCA, QSRs and similar requirements of foreign countries. Some physicians may be using our products in procedures that are not included in the clearance or approval of the products. If the FDA or any other foreign, federal or state enforcement agency were to conclude that we have improperly promoted our products for uncleared or unapproved indications, the FDA or such other agency could allege that our promotional activities misbrand or adulterate our products or violate other legal requirements, which could result in investigations, prosecutions, or other civil or criminal actions. On February 1, 2012, Merit Medical Ireland Ltd., 1 of our wholly owned subsidiaries ( Merit Ireland ), received a warning letter from the FDA (the Warning Letter ) regarding modifications to the coating process for our Laureate Hydrophilic Guidewire (the Guidewire ). In the Warning Letter, the FDA alleged that recent modifications to the Guidewire coating process constitute a significant change or modification that could significantly affect the safety or effectiveness of the Guidewire. The FDA claimed that the Guidewire is adulterated because we do not have an approved application for premarket approval in effect pursuant to Section 515(a) of the FDCA or an approved application for an investigational device exemption under Section 520(g) of the Act. The Warning Letter also sets forth the FDA position that the Guidewire is misbranded under Section 502(o) of the FDCA, because we did not notify the FDA of our intent to introduce the modified Guidewire into commercial distribution, as required by Section 510(k) of the Act. The Warning Letter requested that we provide certain information to the FDA regarding modifications to the Guidewire. We have responded to the Warning Letter; however, there can be no assurance that the FDA will accept our response and approve the actions we have taken with respect to the Guidewire or permit us to manufacture, sell, market or distribute the Guidewire in the United States as currently offered and packaged. There can be no assurances regarding the length of time or cost required to resolve these issues to our satisfaction and to the satisfaction of the FDA. Our inability to resolve these issues in a timely manner may further delay Guidewire launch schedules within and to the United States, which may weaken our competitive position in the market for guidewires or other products. If we are unable to favorably resolve the concerns expressed in the Warning Letter, or if we fail to satisfy any other requirements established by the FDA or 1 or more foreign regulatory authorities, our sales of the Guidewire or other products could be restricted, which could adversely affect our business, operations or financial condition. Furthermore, we may need to devote additional financial and human resources to our efforts to resolve regulatory issues or concerns, and the FDA may elect to take additional regulatory actions. In addition, we are subject to certain export control restrictions administered by the U.S. Department of the Treasury and may be subject to regulations administered by other regulatory agencies in various foreign countries to which our products are exported. Although we believe we are currently in material compliance with these requirements, any failure on our part to comply with all applicable current and future regulations could adversely affect our business, operations, or financial condition. Our products may be subject to recall or product liability claims. Our products are used in connection with invasive procedures and in other medical contexts in which it is important that those products function with precision and accuracy. If our products do not function as designed, or are designed improperly, we may choose to or be forced by regulatory agencies to recall such products from the market. Such a recall could result in significant costs and could divert management attention from our business. In addition, if medical personnel or their patients suffer injury in connection with the use of our products, whether as a 14 Table of Contents result of a failure of our products to function as designed, an inappropriate design or for any other reason, we could be subject to lawsuits seeking significant compensatory and punitive damages. We have previously faced claims by patients claiming injuries from our products. To date, these claims have not resulted in a material negative impact on our operations or financial condition; however, patients or customers may bring claims in a number of circumstances, including if our products were misused, if our products manufacture or design was flawed, if our products produced unsatisfactory results, or if the instructions for use and other disclosure of product related risks for our products were found to be inadequate. The outcome of this type of personal injury litigation is difficult to assess or quantify. We maintain product liability insurance but there is no assurance that this coverage will be sufficient to satisfy any claim made against us. Moreover, any product liability claim brought against us, with or without merit, could result in significant costs, could increase our product liability insurance rates, or could prevent us from securing coverage in the future. As a result, any product recall or lawsuit seeking significant m1tary damages may have a material adverse effect on our business, operations or financial condition. We generally offer a limited warranty for product returns which are due to defects in quality and workmanship. We attempt to estimate our potential liability for future product returns and establish reserves on our financial statements in amounts that we believe will be sufficient to address our warranty obligations; however, our actual liability for product returns may significantly exceed the amount of our reserves. If we underestimate our potential liability for future product returns, or if unanticipated events result in returns that exceed our historical experience, our financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected. We may be unable to protect our proprietary technology or may infringe on the proprietary technology of others. We have obtained U.S. patents and filed additional U.S. and foreign patent applications; however, there can be no assurance that any patents we hold, or for which we have applied, will provide us with any significant competitive advantages, that third parties will not challenge our patents, or that patents owned by others will not have an adverse effect on our ability to conduct business. We could incur substantial costs in preventing patent infringement, in curbing the unauthorized use of our proprietary technology by others, or in defending against similar claims of others. Since we rely on trade secrets and proprietary know how to maintain our competitive position, there can be no assurance that others may not independently develop similar or superior technologies. We operate in an increasingly competitive medical technology marketplace. There has also been substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the medical device industry. Our activities may require us to defend against claims and actions alleging infringement of the intellectual rights of others. If a court rules against us in any patent litigation, any of several negative outcomes could occur we could be subject to significant liabilities, we could be forced to seek licenses from third parties, or we could be prevented from marketing certain products. Any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or operating results. We have been named as a party to a patent infringement lawsuit and are, from time to time, involved in other litigation, regulatory proceedings or other disputes. The outcomes of pending litigation are difficult to predict or quantify. The pending litigation is in its preliminary stages and it is not possible to assess damages or predict an outcome; however, an adverse outcome could limit our ability to sell certain products or reduce our operating margin on the sale of these products. The expense of defending such litigation may be costly and divert our management attention from the day to day operations of our business, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, an unfavorable outcome in such litigation could negatively impact our business, results of operations or cash flows. Similar infringement claims may be asserted against us in the future related to events not presently known to our management. Because we are self insured with respect to intellectual property infringement claims, a significant claim against us could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. Our ability to remain competitive is dependent, in part, upon our ability to prevent other companies from using our proprietary technology incorporated into our products. We seek to protect our technology through a combination of patents, trademarks, and trade secrets, as well as licenses, proprietary know how and confidentiality agreements. We may be unable, however, to prevent others from using our proprietary information, or may be unable to continue to use such information for our own purposes, for numerous reasons, including the following, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business, operations, or financial condition Our issued patents may not be sufficiently broad to prevent others from copying our proprietary technologies. Our issued patents may be challenged by third parties and deemed to be overbroad or unenforceable. Our products may infringe on the patents or other intellectual property rights of other parties, requiring us to alter or discontinue our manufacture or sale of such products. Costs associated with seeking enforcement of our patents against infringement, or defending our activities against 15 Table of Contents allegations of infringement, may be significant. Our pending patent applications may not be granted for various reasons, including over breadth or conflict with an existing patent. Other persons or entities may independently develop, or have developed, similar or superior technologies. All of our patents will eventually expire, and some of our patents, including patents protecting significant elements of our technology, will expire within the next several years. Recent healthcare reform legislation may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act was enacted into law in the U.S. in March 2010. Certain provisions of the legislation will not be effective for a number of years. There are many programs and requirements for which the details have not yet been fully established or consequences not fully understood, and it is unclear what the full impact of the legislation will be. The legislation imposes on medical device manufacturers a 23% excise tax on U.S. sales of certain medical devices beginning in 2013 This tax burden may have a material, negative impact on our results of operations and our cash flows. In addition, the costs of compliance with the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act new reporting and disclosure requirements with regard to payments or other transfers of value made to health care providers may have a material, negative impact on our results of operations and our cash flows. We cannot predict what healthcare programs and regulations will be ultimately implemented at the federal or state level, or the effect of any future legislation or regulation in the U.S. or internationally. However, any changes that lower reimbursements for our products or reduce medical procedure volumes could adversely affect our business and results of operations. The agreements and instruments governing our debt contain restrictions and limitations that could significantly affect our ability to operate our business, as well as significantly affect our liquidity. We have entered into an unsecured Credit Agreement, dated September 10, 2010 (the Credit Agreement ), with the lenders who are or may become party thereto (collectively, the Lenders ) and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association ( Wells Fargo ), as administrative agent for the Lenders. The Credit Agreement contains a number of significant covenants that could adversely affect our ability to operate our business, our liquidity, and our results of operations. These covenants restrict, among other things, our and our subsidiaries ability to incur additional debt; repurchase or redeem equity interests and debt; issue equity; make certain investments or acquisitions; pay dividends or make other distributions; dispose of assets or merge; enter into related party transactions; and grant liens and pledge assets. Our breach of any covenants in the Credit Agreement, not otherwise cured, waived or amended, could result in a default under the applicable debt obligations and could trigger acceleration of those obligations. Any default under the Credit Agreement could adversely affect our ability to service our debt and to fund our planned capital expenditures and ongoing operations. We will be required to expend significant resources for research, development, testing and regulatory approval or clearance of our products under development and these products may not be developed successfully or approved for commercial use. Most of our products under development will require significant additional research, development, engineering and preclinical and or clinical testing, as well as regulatory approval or clearance and a commitment of significant additional resources prior to their commercialization. It is possible that they may not be developed successfully; be proven safe and effective in clinical trials; offer therapeutic or other improvements over current treatments and products; meet applicable regulatory standards or receive regulatory approvals or clearances; be capable of production in commercial quantities at acceptable costs and in compliance with regulatory requirements; or be successfully marketed or covered by private or public insurers. We are currently conducting a clinical trial in an effort to obtain approval from the FDA to claim the use of the QuadraSphere microspheres for the treatment of a specific disease or condition, such as the treatment of liver cancer in the United States. European Union regulations do not currently require such an application for this class of medical device. In order for us to obtain FDA approval or clearance to promote the use of QuadraSphere microspheres for the treatment of liver cancer through embolization, we will need to complete our ongoing clinical trial and submit positive clinical data to the FDA. If we cannot enroll study subjects in sufficient numbers to complete the necessary studies, if there is a disruption in the supply of materials for the trial or if any other factors preclude us from completing the trial in a timely manner we will likely not be able to complete our ongoing clinical trial. Even if we complete our current clinical trial, the FDA may require us to undertake additional testing, or the trial results may not be sufficient to obtain FDA approval for other reasons. If we do not obtain FDA approval, we will not be able to promote our QuadraSphere microspheres for the treatment of specific diseases or conditions (including liver cancer) in the United States. 16 Table of Contents The medical device industry is experiencing greater scrutiny and regulation by governmental authorities. Our medical devices and business activities are subject to rigorous regulation by the FDA and other federal, state and international governmental authorities. These authorities and members of Congress have been increasing their scrutiny over the medical device industry. In recent years, the U.S. Congress, Department of Justice, the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, and the Department of Defense have issued subpoenas and other requests for information to medical device manufacturers, primarily related to financial arrangements with health care providers, regulatory compliance and product promotional practices. We anticipate that the government will continue to scrutinize our industry closely, and that additional regulation by government authorities may increase compliance costs, exposure to litigation, and other adverse effects to our operations. Potential reforms to the FDA 510(k) process could adversely affect our business, operations, or financial condition. In August 2010, the FDA issued its preliminary recommendations on reform of the 510(k) premarket notification process for medical devices. On January 19, 2011, the FDA announced its Plan of Action for implementing these recommendations. The Plan of Action included 25 action Item, including revising existing guidance or developing guidance to clarify various aspects of the 510(k) process and to streamline the review process for innovative, lower risk products (the de novo process); improving training for the Center for Devices and Radiological Health ( CDRH ) staff and industry; increasing reliance on external experts; and addressing and improving internal processes. FDA has already begun implementing many of these reforms, and may implement other reforms in the future, which could have the effect of making it more difficult and expensive for us to obtain 510(k) clearance. Limits on reimbursement imposed by governmental and other programs may adversely affect our business. The cost of a significant portion of medical care is funded by governmental, and other third party insurance programs. Limits on reimbursement imposed by such programs may adversely affect the ability of hospitals and others to purchase our products. In addition, limitations on reimbursement for procedures which utilize our products could adversely affect our business. We are subject to laws targeting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry, the violation of which could adversely affect our business or financial results. Our operations are subject to various state and federal laws targeting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry, including federal anti kickback laws, which prohibit any person from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing or arranging for an item or service, for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Violations of these fraud and abuse related laws are punishable by criminal or civil sanctions, including substantial fines, imprisonment and exclusion from participation in healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, any of which could adversely affect our business or financial results. If our employees or agents violate the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or anti bribery laws in other jurisdictions, we may incur fines or penalties, or experience other adverse consequences. We are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ( FCPA ) and similar anti bribery laws in non U.S. jurisdictions. The FCPA generally prohibits companies and their intermediaries from illegally offering things of value to non U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. As we continue to expand our business activities internationally, compliance with the FCPA and other anti bribery laws presents greater challengers to our operations. If our employees or agents violate the provisions of the FCPA or other anti bribery laws, we may incur fines or penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results or financial condition. Increases in the price of commodity comp1nts, particularly petroleum based products, or loss of supply could have an adverse effect on our business. Many of our products have comp1nts that are manufactured using resins, plastics and other petroleum based materials. Our ability to operate profitably is dependent, in large part, on the availability and pricing of these materials. The availability of these products is affected by a variety of factors beyond our control, including political uncertainty in the Middle East, and there is no assurance that crude oil supplies will not be interrupted in the future. Any such interruption could have an adverse effect on our ability to produce, or on the cost to produce, our products. Also, crude oil prices generally fluctuate based on a number of factors beyond our control, including changes in supply and demand, general economic conditions, labor costs, fuel related transportation costs, competition, import duties, tariffs, currency exchange rates and political uncertainty in the Middle East. Our suppliers may pass some of their cost increases on to us, and if such increased costs are sustained or increase further, our suppliers 17 Table of Contents may pass further cost increases on to us. In addition to the effect on resin prices, transportation costs generally increase based on the effect of higher crude oil prices, and these increased transportation costs may be passed on to us. Our ability to recover such increased costs may depend upon our ability to raise prices on our products. Due to the highly competitive nature of the healthcare industry and the cost containment efforts of our customers and third party payors, we may be unable to pass along cost increases through higher prices. If we are unable to fully recover these costs through price increases or offset these increases through cost reductions, we could experience lower margins and profitability and our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. Economic and industry conditions constantly change, and negative economic conditions in the United States and other countries could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations. Our business and our results of operation are affected by many changing economic and other conditions beyond our control. Actual or potential changes in international, national, regional and local economic, business and financial conditions, including recession and inflation, may negatively affect consumer preferences, perceptions, spending patterns or demographic trends, any of which could adversely affect our business or results of operations. We may also experience higher bad debt rates and slower receivable collection rates in our dealings with our customers. In addition, recent disruptions in the credit markets have resulted in greater volatility, less liquidity, widening of credit spreads, and decreased availability of financing. As a result of these factors, there can be no assurance that financing will be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all. An inability to obtain necessary additional financing on acceptable terms may have an adverse impact on us and on our ability to grow our business. Termination or interruption of relationships with our suppliers, or failure of such suppliers to perform, could disrupt our business. We rely on raw materials, comp1nt parts, finished products, and services supplied by outside third parties in connection with our business. For example, substantially all of our products are sterilized by only a few different entities. In addition, some of our products are manufactured or assembled by third parties. If a supplier of significant raw materials, comp1nt parts, finished goods, or services were to terminate its relationship with us, or otherwise cease supplying raw materials, comp1nt parts, finished goods, or services consistent with past practice, our ability to meet our obligations to our end customers may be disrupted. A disruption with respect to numerous products, or with respect to a few significant products, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations or financial condition. We may be unable to successfully manage growth, particularly if accomplished through acquisitions. Successful implementation of our business strategy will require that we effectively manage any associated growth. To manage growth effectively, our management will need to continue to implement changes in certain aspects of our business, to improve our information systems and operations to respond to increased demand, to attract and retain qualified personnel, and to develop, train, and manage an increasing number of management level and other employees. Growth could place an increasing strain on our management, financial, product design, marketing, distribution and other resources, and we could experience operating difficulties. Any failure to manage growth effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations or financial condition. To the extent that we grow through acquisitions, we will face the additional challenges of integrating the operations, culture, information management systems and other characteristics of the acquired entity with our own. We have incurred, and may incur, significant expenses in connection with negotiating and consummating 1 or more transactions, and we may inherit significant liabilities in connection with prospective acquisitions. In addition, we may not realize competitive advantages, synergies or other benefits anticipated in connection with any such acquisition. If we do not adequately identify targets for, or manage issues related to, our future acquisitions, such acquisitions may have an adverse effect on our business and financial results. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may negatively impact our financial results. Our principal market risk relates to changes in the value of the Euro and Great Britain Pound ( GBP ) relative to the value of the U.S. Dollar. As our operations have grown outside the United States, we have also become subject to market risk relating to the Chinese Yuan, Hong Kong Dollar and the Swedish and Danish Kr1r. Those fluctuations could have a negative impact on our margins and financial results. For example, during 2011, the exchange rate between all applicable foreign currencies and the U.S. Dollar resulted in a decrease in our gross revenues of approximately $19 million. For the year ended December 31, 2011, approximately $59.5 million, or 16.6%, of our sales, were denominated in foreign currencies. If the rate of exchange between the Euro, GBP, Chinese Yuan, Hong Kong Dollar or Swedish or Danish Kr1r declines against the U.S. Dollar, we may not be able to increase the prices we charge our customers for products whose prices are denominated 18 Table of Contents in Euros, GBP, Chinese Yuan, Hong Kong Dollars or Swedish or Danish Kr1r. Furthermore, we may be unable or elect not to enter into hedging transactions which could mitigate the effect of declining exchange rates. As a result, if the rate of exchange between Euros, GBP, Chinese Yuan, Hong Kong Dollars or Swedish or Danish Kr1r declines against the U.S. Dollar, our financial results may be negatively impacted. We depend on generating sufficient cash flow to fund our debt obligations, capital expenditures, and ongoing operations. We are dependent on our cash on hand and free cash flow to fund our debt obligations, capital expenditures and ongoing operations. Our ability to service our debt and to fund our planned capital expenditures and ongoing operations will depend on our ability to continue to generate cash flow. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or we are unable to access additional liquidity sources, we may not be able to service or repay our debt, operate our business, respond to competitive challenges, or fund our other liquidity and capital needs. A significant portion of our revenues are derived from a few products, procedures and or customers. A significant portion of our revenues are attributable to sales of our inflation devices. During the year ended December 31, 2011, sales of our inflation devices (including inflation devices sold in custom kits and through OEM channels) accounted for approximately 19% of our total revenues. Sales of our inflation devices to a single OEM customer, representing our largest customer, were approximately 16% of our total inflation device sales for the year ended December 31, 2011 Any material decline in market demand, or change in OEM supplier preference, for our inflation devices could have an adverse effect on our business, operations or financial condition. In addition, the products that have accounted for a majority of our historical revenues are designed for use in connection with a few related medical procedures, including angioplasty, stent placement procedures, and spinal procedures. If subsequent developments in medical technology or drug therapy make such procedures obsolete, or alter the methodology of such procedures so as to eliminate the usefulness of our products, we may experience a material decrease in demand for our products and experience deteriorating financial performance. We may be unable to compete in our markets, particularly if there is a significant change in relevant practices or technology. The markets in which our products compete are highly competitive. We face competition from many companies which are larger, better established, have greater financial, technical and other resources and possess a greater market presence than we do. Such resources and market presence may enable our competition to more effectively market competing products or to market competing products at reduced prices in order to gain market share. In addition, our ability to compete successfully is dependent, in part, upon our response to changes in technology and upon our efforts to develop and market new products which achieve significant market acceptance. Competing companies with substantially greater resources than us are actively engaged in research and development of new methods, treatments, drugs, and procedures to treat or prevent cardiovascular disease that could limit the market for our products and eventually make some of our products obsolete. A reduction in the demand for a significant number of our products, or a few key products, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations or financial condition. The market price of our Common Stock has been, and may continue to be, volatile. The market price of our Common Stock has at times been, and may in the future be, volatile for various reasons, including those discussed in these risks factors, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations or financial condition. Other events that could cause volatility in our stock, include without limitation, quarter to quarter variances in our financial results; analysts and other projections or recommendations regarding our Common Stock specifically or medical technology stocks generally; any restatement of our financial statements or any investigation of us by the SEC, the FDA or another regulatory authority; or a decline, or rise, of stock prices in the capital markets generally. Operations at our manufacturing facilities may be negatively impacted by certain factors, including severe weather conditions and natural disasters. Our operations could be affected by many factors beyond our control, including severe weather conditions and natural disasters, including hurricanes and tornadoes. These conditions could cause substantial damage to our facilities, interrupt our production and disrupt our ability to deliver products to our customers. Our operations in Angleton, Texas have been suspended due to hurricanes in recent years. In September 2008, we shut 19 Table of Contents down our operations in Angleton in anticipation of Hurricane Ike and production was restored shortly thereafter. While we incurred minimal damage to our facility, we experienced greater financial damage as a result of the production disruption. Although our insurance proceeds covered some of the losses associated with the event, future natural disasters could increase the cost of insurance. We cannot be certain that any losses from business interruption or property damage, along with potential increases in insurance costs, will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. We are dependent upon key personnel. Our success is dependent on key management personnel, including Fred P. Lampropoulos, our Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Lampropoulos is not subject to any agreement prohibiting his departure, and we do not maintain key man life insurance on his life. The loss of Mr. Lampropoulos, or of certain other key management personnel, could have a materially adverse effect on our business and operations. Our success also depends on, among other factors, the successful recruitment and retention of key operating, manufacturing, sales and other personnel. We are subject to work stoppage, transportation and related risks. We manufacture products at various locations in the United States and foreign countries and sell our products worldwide. We depend on third party transportation companies to deliver supplies necessary to manufacture our products from vendors to our various facilities and to move our products to customers, operating divisions, and other subsidiaries located worldwide. Our manufacturing operations, and the operations of the transportation companies on which we depend, may be adversely affected by natural disasters or significant human events, such as a war, terrorist attack, riot, strike, slowdown or similar event. Any disruption in our manufacturing or transportation could materially and adversely affect our ability to meet customer demands or our operations. Domestic and international economic conditions could adversely affect our business and results of operations. We are subject to risks arising from adverse changes in general domestic and global economic conditions, including the current global economic slowdown, European sovereign debt crisis, and disruption of credit markets. There can be no assurance that there will not be further deterioration in global or regional economies. Our customers may experience financial difficulties or be unable to borrow m1y to fund their operations which may adversely impact their ability or decision to purchase or pay for our products. For example, our customers, particularly in the European region, may extend or delay payments for products already provided, which may lead to collectability concerns with respect to our accounts receivable. The strength and timing of any economic recovery remains uncertain, and we cannot predict to what extent the global economic slowdown and European sovereign debt crisis may negatively impact our average selling prices, our net sales and profit margins, procedural volumes and reimbursement rates from third party payors. Our failure to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations could affect our business and results of operations. We manufacture and assemble certain products that require the use of hazardous materials that are subject to various national, federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment, health and safety. While the cost of compliance with such laws and regulations has not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations historically, compliance with future regulations may require additional capital investments. Additionally, because we use hazardous and other regulated materials in our manufacturing processes, we are subject to certain risks of future liabilities, lawsuits and claims resulting from any substances we manufactured, disposed of or released. Any accidental release may have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. We cannot predict what additional environmental, health and safety legislation or regulations will be enacted or become effective in the future or how existing or future laws or regulations will be administered or interpreted with respect to our operations, capital expenditures, results of operations or competitive position. Compliance with more stringent laws or regulations or adverse changes in the interpretation of existing laws or regulations by government agencies could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and the results of our operations and could require substantial expenditures.
