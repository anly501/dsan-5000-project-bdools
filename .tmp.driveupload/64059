<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">While we may acquire a business in any industry,
our focus is on the healthcare industry in the United States and other developed countries. We believe the healthcare industry,
particularly the life sciences and medical technology sectors, represents an enormous and growing target market with a large number
of potential target acquisition opportunities.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">Healthcare spending in the U.S. currently
exceeds $3.6 trillion. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services estimate that total U.S. national health expenditures will
exceed $6.2&nbsp;trillion by 2028, more than doubling over a 20-year timeframe and reaching nearly 20% of U.S. GDP. At the same
time, populations in developed countries are aging and gaining greater access to healthcare, increasing the demand within healthcare
systems. Additionally, the number of private companies in the healthcare industry is significant, with over 30,000 firms focused
on various sub-sectors of the healthcare value chain in the United States alone according to S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence.
The market dynamics are similar in Europe and other developed countries. We intend to focus our investment effort broadly across
the healthcare industry, which encompasses biotechnology, pharmaceuticals, services, and medical technology sub-sectors. We believe
that our investing and operating expertise, network of venture partners, and strong relationships throughout the healthcare industry
will give us a large, addressable universe of potential targets. This, along with the positive tailwinds in the healthcare industry
maximizes the likelihood that our management team will be able to identify and execute an attractive transaction.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">We believe that the current state of the
medical technology and life sciences IPO markets may enhance our ability to locate an attractive target. Over 200 life sciences
and medical technology companies have gone public since 2016 in the United States.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">We believe that privately held medical technology
and life sciences companies represent an enormous investment opportunity, and recent trends in equity capital markets continue
to demonstrate the desire of these companies to access public capital. Since 2015, approximately $298&nbsp;billion has been raised
in the public equity markets by medical technology and life sciences companies. Approximately $48&nbsp;billion has been raised
through initial public offerings of 320 life sciences companies and approximately $6&nbsp;billion has been raised through initial
public offerings of 42 medical technology companies. We believe an acquisition by a special purpose acquisition company with a
management team that is well-known and respected in the industry can provide a more transparent and efficient mechanism to bring
a private healthcare company to the public markets. We also believe the combination of a strong IPO market and the benefits from
being publicly traded, including greater access to capital, more liquid securities, and increased customer awareness will help
us bring an attractive company to the public markets.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">We intend to capitalize on the platforms
of our two founders, HealthCor and Catalio. Both founders have experience in investing across a variety of healthcare sub-sectors
and a track record of identifying high-quality assets, businesses and management teams. We believe HealthCor&rsquo;s bottom-up
fundamental research together with Catalio&rsquo;s access to a group of world-renowned, serial scientist-entrepreneurs improve
our ability to identify and acquire potential targets. Our selection process will leverage our relationships with leading venture
capitalists and growth equity funds, executives of private and public companies, leading investment banking firms, and world-renowned
scientists and medical professionals, which we believe should provide us with a key competitive advantage in sourcing potential
business combination targets. Given our profile and dedicated industry approach, we anticipate that target business candidates
may be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, and in particular investors in other private and public companies
in our networks. We also believe that our experience, reputation, access to experienced serial scientist-entrepreneurs, and track
record in healthcare investing will make us a preferred partner for potential targets. Consistent with our strategy, we intend
to see to acquire companies that we believe:</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">Our initial business combination must occur
with one or more target businesses that together have an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the net assets held in
the trust account (excluding the amount of deferred underwriting discounts held in trust and taxes payable on the interest earned
on the trust account) at the time of signing the agreement to enter into the initial business combination. The fair market value
of the target or targets will be determined by our board of directors based upon one or more standards generally accepted by the
financial community (such as actual and potential sales, earnings, cash flow and/or book value). Even though our board of directors
will rely on generally accepted standards, our board of directors  has discretion to select the standards employed. In addition,
the application of the standards generally involves a substantial degree of judgment. Accordingly, investors will be relying on
the business judgment of the board of directors in evaluating the fair market value of the target or targets. The proxy solicitation
materials or tender offer documents used by us in connection with any proposed transaction will provide public shareholders with
our analysis of our satisfaction of the 80% of fair market value test, as well as the basis for our determinations. If our board
of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses or we are considering
an initial business combination with an affiliated entity, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm
which is a member of FINRA or an independent valuation or accounting firm with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. Our
shareholders may not be provided with a copy of such opinion nor will they be able to rely on such opinion. While we consider it
unlikely that our board will not be able to make an independent determination of the fair market value of a target business or
businesses, it may be unable to do so if the board is less familiar or experienced with the target company&rsquo;s business, there
is a significant amount of uncertainty as to the value of the company&rsquo;s assets or prospects, including if such company is
at an early stage of development, operations or growth, or if the anticipated transaction involves a complex financial analysis
or other specialized skills and the board determines that outside expertise would be helpful or necessary in conducting such analysis.
Since any opinion, if obtained, would merely state that the fair market value of the target business meets the 80% of fair market
value test, unless such opinion includes material information regarding the valuation of a target business or the consideration
to be provided, it is not anticipated that copies of such opinion would be distributed to our shareholders. However, if required
under applicable law, any proxy statement that we deliver to shareholders and file with the SEC in connection with a proposed transaction
will include such opinion.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">We anticipate structuring our initial business
combination so that the post-business combination company in which our public shareholders own shares will own or acquire 100%
of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination
such that the post-business combination company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business
in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or shareholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete
such business combination if the post-business combination company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities
of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an
investment company under the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-business combination company owns or acquires 50% or more
of the voting securities of the target, our shareholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest
in the post-business combination company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination transaction.
For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding
capital stock, shares or other equity interests of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the
target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our shareholders immediately prior to the completion
of our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our issued and outstanding shares subsequent to our initial
business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired
by the post-business combination company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be
valued for purposes of the 80% of fair market value test. If the business combination involves more than one target business, the
80% of fair market value test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses and we will treat the target
businesses together as the initial business combination for purposes of a tender offer or for seeking shareholder approval, as
applicable. In addition, we have agreed not to enter into a definitive agreement regarding an initial business combination without
the prior consent of our sponsor.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">In addition, our sponsor has indicated an
interest to purchase up to an aggregate of $25,000,000 of our Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares in a private placement that would occur
concurrently with the consummation of our initial business combination. However, because indications of interest are not binding
agreements or commitments to purchase, our sponsor may determine not to purchase any such shares, or to purchase fewer shares than
it has indicated an interest in purchasing. Furthermore, we are not under any obligation to sell any such shares. If we sell shares
to our sponsor (or any other investor) in connection with our initial business combination, the equity interest of investors in
our initial public offering in the combined company may be diluted and the market prices for our securities may be adversely affected.
In addition, if the per share trading price of our ordinary shares is greater than the price per share paid in the private placement,
the private placement will result in value dilution to you.</P>

to their fiduciary duties under Cayman Islands law, he or she will need to honor such fiduciary or contractual obligations to present
such business combination opportunity to such entity, before we can pursue such opportunity. If these other entities decide to
pursue any such opportunity, we may be precluded from pursuing the same. In addition, investment ideas generated within or presented

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">We believe our structure will make us an
attractive business combination partner to target businesses. As an existing public company, we offer a target business an alternative
to the traditional initial public offering through a merger or other business combination with us. In a business combination transaction
with us, the owners of the target business may, for example, exchange their shares of stock, shares or other equity interests in
the target business for our Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares (or shares of a new holding company) or for a combination of our Class&nbsp;A
ordinary shares and cash, allowing us to tailor the consideration to the specific needs of the sellers. We believe target businesses
will find this method a more expeditious and cost effective method to becoming a public company than the typical initial public
offering. The typical initial public offering process takes a significantly longer period of time than the typical business combination
transaction process, and there are significant expenses in the initial public offering process, including underwriting discounts
and commissions, that may not be present to the same extent in connection with a business combination with us.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">Furthermore, once a proposed business combination
is completed, the target business will have effectively become public, whereas an initial public offering is always subject to
the underwriter&rsquo;s ability to complete the offering, as well as general market conditions, which could delay or prevent the
offering from occurring or have negative valuation consequences. Once public, we believe the target business would then have greater
access to capital, an additional means of providing management incentives consistent with shareholders&rsquo; interests and the
ability to use its shares as currency for acquisitions. Being a public company can offer further benefits by augmenting a company&rsquo;s
profile among potential new customers and vendors and aid in attracting talented employees.</P>

our status as a blank check company, such as our lack of an operating history and our ability to seek shareholder approval of any
proposed initial business combination, negatively.</P>

initially in the amount of $200,755,000 after payment of the estimated expenses of our initial public offering and $7,245,000 of
deferred underwriting fees, we offer a target business a variety of options such as creating a liquidity event for its owners,
providing capital for the potential growth and expansion of its operations or strengthening its balance sheet by reducing its debt
ratio. Because we are able to complete our initial business combination using our cash, debt or equity securities, or a combination
of the foregoing, we have the flexibility to use the most efficient combination that will allow us to tailor the consideration
to be paid to the target business to fit its needs and desires. However, we have not taken any steps to secure third party financing
and there can be no assurance it will be available to us.</P>

to forward purchase agreements or backstop agreements we may enter into following the consummation of our initial public offering

the risks inherent in a particular target business with which we may combine, we cannot assure you that this assessment will result

There are no prohibitions on our ability to issue securities or incur debt in connection with our initial business combination.

transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would require us to seek shareholder approval under applicable law or stock
exchange listing requirement or whether we were deemed to be a foreign private issuer (which would require a tender offer rather
than seeking shareholder approval under SEC rules). Asset acquisitions and share purchases would not typically require shareholder
approval while direct mergers with our company where we do not survive and any transactions where we issue more than 20% of our
issued and outstanding ordinary shares or seek to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association would typically
require shareholder approval. We currently intend to conduct redemptions in connection with a shareholder vote unless shareholder

accumulating large blocks of shares, and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to exercise their redemption
rights against a proposed business combination as a means to force us or our management to purchase their shares at a significant
premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. Absent this provision, a public shareholder holding more
than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in our initial public offering could threaten to exercise its redemption rights if
such holder&rsquo;s shares are not purchased by us, our sponsor or our management team at a premium to the then-current market

offer materials, as applicable, that we will furnish to holders of our public shares in connection with our initial business combination

materials until the close of the tender offer period, or up to two business days prior to the initially scheduled vote on the proposal
to approve the business combination if we distribute proxy materials, as applicable, to tender its shares if it wishes to seek

the above-referenced tendering process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC System. The
transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker a fee of approximately $80.00 and it would be up to the broker whether
or not to pass this cost on to the redeeming holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require
holders seeking to exercise redemption rights to tender their shares. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising
redemption rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated.</P>

used by many blank check companies. In order to perfect redemption rights in connection with their business combinations, many
blank check companies would distribute proxy materials for the shareholders&rsquo; vote on an initial business combination, and
a holder could simply vote against a proposed business combination and check a box on the proxy card indicating such holder was
seeking to exercise his or her redemption rights. After the business combination was approved, the company would contact such shareholder
to arrange for him or her to deliver his or her certificate to verify ownership. As a result, the shareholder then had an &ldquo;option
window&rdquo; after the completion of the business combination during which he or she could monitor the price of the company&rsquo;s
shares in the market. If the price rose above the redemption price, he or she could sell his or her shares in the open market before
actually delivering his or her shares to the company for cancellation. As a result, the redemption rights, to which shareholders
were aware they needed to commit before the general meeting, would become &ldquo;option&rdquo; rights surviving past the completion
of the business combination until the redeeming holder delivered its certificate. The requirement for physical or electronic delivery
prior to the meeting ensures that a redeeming shareholder&rsquo;s election to redeem is irrevocable once the business combination
is approved.</P>

made, may be withdrawn at any time up to two business days prior to the initially scheduled vote on the proposal to approve the

connection with an election of redemption rights and subsequently decides prior to the applicable date not to elect to exercise
such rights, such holder may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically). It is
anticipated that the funds to be distributed to holders of our public shares electing to redeem their shares will be distributed

$5,000,001 (so that we do not then become subject to the SEC&rsquo;s &ldquo;penny stock&rdquo; rules). If this optional redemption
right is exercised with respect to an excessive number of public shares such that we cannot satisfy the net tangible asset

right shall apply in the event of the approval of any such amendment, whether proposed by our sponsor, any executive officer,

service providers (excluding our independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses and other entities

or even if they execute such agreements that they would be prevented from bringing claims against the trust account including but
not limited to fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging
the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain an advantage with respect to a claim against our assets, including
the funds held in the trust account. If any third party refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held
in the trust account, our management will perform an analysis of the alternatives available to it and will only enter into an agreement
with a third party that has not executed a waiver if management believes that such third party&rsquo;s engagement would be significantly
more beneficial to us than any alternative. Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third party that refuses to execute
a waiver include the engagement of a third party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to
be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where management is unable
to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver. The underwriter will not execute agreements with us waiving such claims
to the monies held in the trust account. In addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they
may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse
against the trust account for any reason. In order to protect the amounts held in the trust account, our sponsor has agreed that
it will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a vendor for services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective
target business with which we have discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amounts in the trust account to
below the lesser of (i)&nbsp;$10.00 per public share and (ii)&nbsp;the actual amount per public share held in the trust account
as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account if less than $10.00 per public share due to reductions in the value of the

not apply to any claims by a third party or prospective target business who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access
to the trust account nor will it apply to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriter of our initial public offering against
certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable
against a third party, our sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third party claims. However,
we have not asked our sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations, nor have we independently verified whether our sponsor
has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations and we believe that our sponsor&rsquo;s only assets are securities of
our company. Our sponsor may not be able to satisfy those obligations. None of our officers or directors will indemnify us for
claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses.</P>

In the event that we liquidate and it is subsequently determined that the reserve for claims and liabilities is insufficient, shareholders
who received funds from our trust account could be liable for claims made by creditors; however such liability will not be greater
than the amount of funds from our trust account received by any such shareholder. In the event that our offering expenses exceed
our estimate of $1,000,000, we may fund such excess with funds from the funds not to be held in the trust account. In such case,
the amount of funds we intend to be held outside the trust account would decrease by a corresponding amount. Conversely, in the

objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, public companies,

identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater
financial, technical, human and other resources than us. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our
available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business.
Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public shareholders who properly exercise their redemption rights
may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination, and the future dilution they potentially represent,
may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in

law or stock exchange listing requirements or if we decide to hold a shareholder vote for business or other reasons. For instance,
the Nasdaq rules&nbsp;currently allow us to engage in a tender offer in lieu of a general meeting but would still require us to
obtain shareholder approval if we were seeking to issue more than 20% of our issued and outstanding shares to a target business
as consideration in any business combination. Therefore, if we were structuring a business combination that required us to issue
more than 20% of our issued and outstanding ordinary shares, we would seek shareholder approval of such business combination. However,
except as required by applicable law or stock exchange rule, the decision as to whether we will seek shareholder approval of a
proposed business combination or will allow shareholders to sell their shares to us in a tender offer will be made by us, solely
in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors, such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the
transaction would otherwise require us to seek shareholder approval. Accordingly, we may consummate our initial business combination
even if holders of a majority of the outstanding ordinary shares do not approve of the business combination we consummate. Please

transaction agreement with a prospective target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain
amount of cash. If too many public shareholders exercise their redemption rights, we would not be able to meet such closing condition
and, as a result, would not be able to proceed with the business combination. Furthermore, in no event will we redeem our public
shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 upon consummation of our initial business
combination and payment of deferred underwriting commissions (so that we do not then become subject to the SEC&rsquo;s &ldquo;penny
stock&rdquo; rules) or any greater net tangible asset or cash requirement which may be contained in the agreement relating to our
initial business combination. Consequently, if accepting all properly submitted redemption requests would cause our net tangible
assets to be less than $5,000,001 upon consummation of our initial business combination and payment of deferred underwriting commissions
or such greater amount necessary to satisfy a closing condition as described above, we would not proceed with such redemption and
the related business combination and may instead search for an alternate business combination. Prospective targets will be aware
of these risks and, thus, may be reluctant to enter into a business combination transaction with us.</P>

<P STYLE="text-align: left; font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">At the time we enter into an agreement for
our initial business combination, we will not know how many shareholders may exercise their redemption rights, and therefore will
need to structure the transaction based on our expectations as to the number of shares that will be submitted for redemption. If
our initial business combination agreement requires us to use a portion of the cash in the trust account to pay the purchase price,
or requires us to have a minimum amount of cash at closing, we will need to reserve a portion of the cash in the trust account
to meet such requirements, or arrange for third-party financing. In addition, if a large number of shares are submitted for redemption,
we may need to restructure the transaction to reserve a greater portion of the cash in the trust account or arrange for additional
third-party financing. Raising additional third-party financing may involve dilutive equity issuances or the incurrence of indebtedness
at higher than desirable levels. Furthermore, this dilution would increase to the extent that the anti-dilution provisions of the
Class&nbsp;B ordinary shares result in the issuance of Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares on a greater than one-to-one basis upon conversion
of the Class&nbsp;B ordinary shares at the time of our business combination. The above considerations may limit our ability to
complete the most desirable business combination available to us or optimize our capital structure. The amount of the deferred
underwriting commissions payable to the underwriter will not be adjusted for any shares that are redeemed in connection with an
initial business combination. The per-share amount we will distribute to shareholders who properly exercise their redemption rights
will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commission and after such redemptions, the amount held in trust will continue
to reflect our obligation to pay the entire deferred underwriting commissions.</P>

the trust account. If you are in need of immediate liquidity, you could attempt to sell your shares in the open market; however,
at such time our shares may trade at a discount to the pro&nbsp;rata amount per share in the trust account. In either situation,

coronavirus was reported to have surfaced in Wuhan, China, which has and is continuing to spread throughout the world, including
the United States. On January&nbsp;30, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19)
a &ldquo;Public Health Emergency of International Concern.&rdquo; On January&nbsp;31, 2020, U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary
Alex M. Azar II declared a public health emergency for the United States to aid the U.S. healthcare community in responding to
COVID-19, and on March&nbsp;11, 2020 the World Health Organization characterized the outbreak as a &ldquo;pandemic&rdquo;. The
COVID-19 outbreak has resulted, and a significant outbreak of other infectious diseases could result, in a widespread health crisis
that adversely affects the economies and financial markets worldwide, and the business of any potential target business with which
we consummate a business combination could be materially and adversely affected. Furthermore, we may be unable to complete a business
combination if continued concerns relating to COVID-19 continue to restrict travel, limit the ability to have meetings with potential
investors or the target company&rsquo;s personnel, vendors and services providers are unavailable to negotiate and consummate a
transaction in a timely manner. The extent to which COVID-19 impacts our search for a business combination will depend on future
developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity
of COVID-19 and the actions to contain COVID-19 or treat its impact, among others. If the disruptions posed by COVID-19 or other
matters of global concern continue for an extensive period of time, our ability to consummate a business combination, or the operations
of a target business with which we ultimately consummate a business combination, may be materially adversely affected. In addition,
our ability to consummate a transaction may be dependent on the ability to raise equity and debt financing which may be impacted
by COVID-19 and other events, including as a result of increased market volatility, decreased market liquidity and third-party
financing being unavailable on terms acceptable to us or at all.</P>

of covered securities in a particular case. While we are not aware of a state having used these powers to prohibit or restrict
the sale of securities issued by blank check companies, other than the State of Idaho, certain state securities regulators view

we intend to acquire. Many of these individuals and entities are well-established and have extensive experience in identifying
and effecting, directly or indirectly, acquisitions of companies operating in or providing services to various industries. Many
of these competitors possess greater technical, human and other resources or more local industry knowledge than we do and our financial
resources will be relatively limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors. While we believe there are numerous
target businesses we could potentially acquire with the net proceeds of our initial public offering and the sale of the private
placement shares our ability to compete with respect to the acquisition of certain target businesses that are sizable will be limited
by our available financial resources. This inherent competitive limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition
of certain target businesses. Furthermore, we are obligated to offer holders of our public shares the right to redeem their shares
for cash at the time of our initial business combination in conjunction with a shareholder vote or via a tender offer. Target companies

may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating a business combination. If we have not consummated our initial

designed to keep target businesses from &ldquo;shopping&rdquo; around for transactions with other companies or investors on terms
more favorable to such target businesses) with respect to a particular proposed business combination, although we do not have any
current intention to do so. If we entered into a letter of intent where we paid for the right to receive exclusivity from a target

the offering expenses are less than our estimate of $1,000,000, the amount of funds we intend to be held outside the trust account
would increase by a corresponding amount. The amount held in the trust account will not be impacted as a result of such increase
or decrease. If we are required to seek additional capital, we would need to borrow funds from our sponsor, members of our management
team or any of their affiliates or other third parties to operate or may be forced to liquidate. Neither our sponsor, members of
our management team nor any of their affiliates is under any obligation to advance funds to us in such circumstances. Any such
advances may be repaid only from funds held outside the trust account or from funds released to us upon completion of our initial
business combination. Up to $1,500,000 of such loans may be convertible into shares of the post-business combination entity at
a price of $10.00 per share at the option of the lender. The shares would be identical to the private placement shares. Prior to
the completion of our initial business combination, we do not expect to seek loans from parties other than our sponsor, members
of our management team or any of their affiliates as we do not believe third parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide
a waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in our trust account. If we do not complete our initial business combination

if and to the extent any claims by a third party (excluding our independent registered public accounting firm) for services rendered

nor have we independently verified whether our sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations and we believe

our independent directors would determine whether to take legal action against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations.
While we currently expect that our independent directors would take legal action on our behalf against our sponsor to enforce its
indemnification obligations to us, it is possible that our independent directors in exercising their business judgment and subject
to their fiduciary duties may choose not to do so in any particular instance. If our independent directors choose not to enforce
these indemnification obligations, the amount of funds in the trust account available for distribution to our public shareholders

Accordingly, any indemnification provided will be able to be satisfied by us only if (i)&nbsp;we have sufficient funds outside

may discourage shareholders from bringing a lawsuit against our officers or directors for breach of their fiduciary duty. These

combination. In order to obtain directors and officers liability insurance or modify its coverage as a result of becoming a public
company, the post-business combination entity might need to incur greater expense, accept less favorable terms or both. However,
any failure to obtain adequate directors and officers liability insurance could have an adverse impact on the post-business combination&rsquo;s

from claims arising from conduct alleged to have occurred prior to the initial business combination. As a result, in order to
protect our directors and officers, the post-business combination entity may need to purchase additional insurance with respect
to any such claims (&ldquo;run-off insurance&rdquo;). The need for run-off insurance would be an added expense for the post-business
combination entity, and could interfere with or frustrate our ability to consummate an initial business combination on terms favorable
to our investors.</P>

and availability of such a significant number of securities for trading in the public market may have an adverse effect on the
market price of our Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares. In addition, the existence of the registration rights may make our initial business
combination more costly or difficult to conclude. This is because the shareholders of the target business may increase the equity
stake they seek in the combined entity or ask for more cash consideration to offset the negative impact on the market price of
our securities that is expected when the securities owned by our initial shareholders or their permitted transferees are registered
for resale.</P>

in any sector, except that we will not, under our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, be permitted to
effectuate our initial business combination with another blank check company or similar company with nominal operations. Because
we have not yet selected or approached any specific target business with respect to a business combination, there is no basis to
evaluate the possible merits or risks of any particular target business&rsquo;s operations, results of operations, cash flows,
liquidity, financial condition or prospects. To the extent we complete our initial business combination, we may be affected by
numerous risks inherent in the business operations with which we combine. For example, if we combine with a financially unstable
business or an entity lacking an established record of sales or earnings, we may be affected by the risks inherent in the business
and operations of a financially unstable or a development stage entity. Although our officers and directors will endeavor to evaluate
the risks inherent in a particular target business, we may not properly ascertain or assess all of the significant risk factors
or that we will have adequate time to complete due diligence. Furthermore, some of these risks may be outside of our control and
leave us with no ability to control or reduce the chances that those risks will adversely impact a target business. An investment
in our&nbsp;Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares may not ultimately prove to be more favorable to investors than a direct investment, if
such opportunity were available, in a business combination target. Accordingly, any holders who choose to retain their securities
following our initial business combination could suffer a reduction in the value of their securities. Such holders are unlikely
to have a remedy for such reduction in value.</P>

<P STYLE="text-align: left; font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">Healthcare related companies are generally
subject to greater governmental regulation than most other industries at the U.S. state and federal levels, and internationally.
In recent&nbsp;years, both local and national governmental budgets have come under pressure to reduce spending and control healthcare
costs, which could both adversely affect regulatory processes and public funding available for healthcare products, services and
facilities. In March&nbsp;2010, comprehensive healthcare reform legislation was enacted in the United States. These laws are intended
to increase health insurance coverage through individual and employer mandates, subsidies offered to lower income individuals,
tax credits available to smaller employers and broadening of Medicaid eligibility.</P>

<P STYLE="text-align: left; font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="text-align: left; font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">While one intent of healthcare reform is
to expand health insurance coverage to more individuals, it may also involve additional regulatory mandates and other measures
designed to constrain medical costs, including coverage and reimbursement for healthcare services. Healthcare reform has had a
significant impact on the healthcare sector in the United States and consequently has the ability to affect companies within the
healthcare industry. The ultimate effects of federal healthcare reform or any future legislation or regulation, or healthcare initiatives,
if any, on the healthcare sector, whether implemented at the federal or state level or internationally, cannot be predicted with
certainty and such reform, legislation, regulation or initiatives may adversely affect the performance of a potential business
combination.</P>

<P STYLE="text-align: left; font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">Changes in governmental policies may have
a material effect on the demand for or costs of certain products and services. A healthcare related company must receive government
approval before introducing new drugs and medical devices or procedures. This process may delay the introduction of these products
and services to the marketplace, resulting in increased development costs, delayed cost recovery and loss of competitive advantage
to the extent that rival companies have developed competing products or procedures, adversely affecting the company&rsquo;s revenues
and profitability. Failure to obtain governmental approval of a key drug or device or other regulatory action could have a material
adverse effect on the business of a target company. Additionally, expansion of facilities by healthcare related providers is subject
to &ldquo;determinations of need&rdquo; by the appropriate government authorities. This process not only increases the time and
cost involved in these expansions, but also makes expansion plans uncertain, limiting the revenue and profitability growth potential
of healthcare related facilities operators.</P>

<P STYLE="text-align: left; font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">Certain healthcare related companies depend
on the exclusive rights or patents for the products they develop and distribute. Patents have a limited duration and, upon expiration,
other companies may market substantially similar &ldquo;generic&rdquo; products that are typically sold at a lower price than the
patented product, causing the original developer of the product to lose market share and/or reduce the price charged for the product,
resulting in lower profits for the original developer. As a result, the expiration of patents may adversely affect the profitability
of these companies. The profitability of healthcare related companies may also be affected, among other factors, by restrictions
on government reimbursement for medical expenses, rising or falling costs of medical products and services, pricing pressure, an
increased emphasis on outpatient services, a limited product offering, industry innovation, changes in technologies and other market
developments. Finally, because the products and services of healthcare related companies affect the health and well-being of many
individuals, these companies are especially susceptible to product liability lawsuits.</P>

<P STYLE="text-align: left; font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">The healthcare industry spends heavily on
research and development. Research findings (e.g., regarding side effects or comparative benefits of one or more particular treatments,
services or products) and technological innovation (together with patent expirations) may make any particular treatment, service
or product less attractive if previously unknown or underappreciated risks are revealed, or if a more effective, less costly or
less risky solution is or becomes available. Any such development could have a material adverse effect on the companies that are
target businesses for investment.</P>

We also cannot assure you that an investment in our&nbsp;Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares will not ultimately prove to be less favorable

<P STYLE="text-align: left; font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">Although we have identified general criteria
for evaluating prospective target businesses, it is possible that a target business with which we enter into our initial business
combination will not have all of these positive attributes. If we complete our initial business combination with a target that
does not meet some or all of these criteria, such combination may not be as successful as a combination with a business that does
meet all of our general criteria. In addition, if we announce a prospective business combination with a target that does not meet
our general criteria, a greater number of shareholders may exercise their redemption rights, which may make it difficult for us
to meet any closing condition with a target business that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash.
In addition, if shareholder approval of the transaction is required by applicable law or stock exchange rule, or we decide to obtain
shareholder approval for business or other reasons, it may be more difficult for us to attain shareholder approval of our initial
business combination if the target business does not meet our general criteria. If we do not complete our initial business combination
within the required time period, our public shareholders may receive only approximately $10.00 per public share, or less in certain
circumstances, on the liquidation of our trust account.</P>

Our sponsor, officers and directors are not currently aware of any specific opportunities for us to complete our initial business

our sponsor 4,312,500 founder shares in exchange for a capital contribution of $25,000, or approximately $0.006 per share. On January&nbsp;26,
2021, we effected a share capitalization pursuant to which we issued 862,500 additional Class&nbsp;B ordinary shares, resulting
in our initial shareholders holding 5,175,000 Class&nbsp;B ordinary shares. Prior to the initial investment in the company of $25,000
by the sponsor, the company had no assets, tangible or intangible. In December&nbsp;2020, our sponsor transferred 35,000 Class&nbsp;B
ordinary shares to each of Dr.&nbsp;Wolfgang and Mr.&nbsp;Weinstein for their service as independent directors. In January&nbsp;2021,
our sponsor transferred 35,000 Class&nbsp;B ordinary shares to Mr.&nbsp;Harris for his service as an independent director. These
105,000 founder shares were not subject to forfeiture from the exercise of the underwriter&rsquo;s over-allotment option. The per
share price of the founder shares was determined by dividing the amount contributed to the company by the number of founder shares
issued. The founder shares will be worthless if we do not complete an initial business combination. In addition, our sponsor purchased
614,000 private placement shares, at a price of $10.00 per share ($6,140,000 in the aggregate), in a private placement that will
closed simultaneously with the closing of our initial public offering. If we do not consummate an initial business within 24&nbsp;months
from the closing of our initial public offering, the private placement shares will be worthless. The personal and financial interests
of our executive officers and directors may influence their motivation in identifying and selecting a target business combination,
completing an initial business combination and influencing the operation of the business following the initial business combination.
This risk may become more acute as the 24-month anniversary of the closing of our initial public offering nears, which is the deadline
for our consummation of an initial business combination.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">We may structure our initial business combination
so that the post-business combination company in which our public shareholders own shares will own less than 100% of the equity
interests or assets of a target business, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-business combination
company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest
in the target business sufficient for us not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act.
We will not consider any transaction that does not meet such criteria. Even if the post-business combination company owns 50% or
more of the voting securities of the target, our shareholders prior to the completion of our initial business combination may collectively
own a minority interest in the post-business combination company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the
business combination. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new Class&nbsp;A ordinary
shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock, shares or other equity interests of a target. In this case, we would
acquire a 100% interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new Class&nbsp;A ordinary
shares, our shareholders immediately prior to such transaction could own less than a majority of our outstanding Class&nbsp;A ordinary
shares subsequent to such transaction. In addition, other minority shareholders may subsequently combine their holdings resulting
in a single person or group obtaining a larger portion of the company&rsquo;s shares than we initially acquired. Accordingly, this
may make it more likely that our management will not be able to maintain control of the target business.</P>

We cannot predict whether investors will find our securities less attractive because we will rely on these exemptions. If some
investors find our securities less attractive as a result of our reliance on these exemptions, the trading prices of our securities
may be lower than they otherwise would be, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the trading prices
of our securities may be more volatile.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">Further, Section&nbsp;102(b)(1)&nbsp;of
the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards
until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not
have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting
standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements
that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such an election to opt out is irrevocable. We have elected not to opt out
of such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates
for public or private companies, we, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies
adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of our financial statements with another public company which is neither
an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult
or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.</P>

company&rdquo; as defined in Item&nbsp;10(f)(1)&nbsp;of Regulation&nbsp;S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of
certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two&nbsp;years of audited financial statements.
We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (1)&nbsp;the market value of our ordinary
shares held by non-affiliates equals or exceeds $250,000,000 as of the prior June&nbsp;30, and (2)&nbsp;our annual revenues equaled
or exceeded $100,000,000 during such completed fiscal year or the market value of our ordinary shares held by non-affiliates equals

may also make comparison of our financial statements with other public companies difficult or impossible.</P>

the time and costs of completing an acquisition.</B></P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">Section&nbsp;404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
requires that we evaluate and report on our system of internal controls beginning with our annual report on Form&nbsp;10-K for
the year ending December&nbsp;31, 2021. Only in the event we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer or an accelerated filer
and no longer qualify as an emerging growth company, will we be required to comply with the independent registered public accounting
firm attestation requirement on our internal control over financial reporting. The fact that we are a blank check company makes
compliance with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act particularly burdensome on us as compared to other public companies
because a target business with which we seek to complete our initial business combination may not be in compliance with the provisions
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of its internal controls. The development of the internal control of any such entity
to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such acquisition.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">We are an exempted company incorporated

shareholders will be governed by our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, the Companies Act (as the same
may be supplemented or amended from time to time) and the common law of the Cayman Islands. We will also be subject to the federal
securities laws of the United States. The rights of shareholders to take action against the directors, actions by minority shareholders
and the fiduciary responsibilities of our directors to us under Cayman Islands law are to a large extent governed by the common
law of the Cayman Islands. The common law of the Cayman Islands is derived in part from comparatively limited judicial precedent
in the Cayman Islands as well as from English common law, the decisions of whose courts are of persuasive authority, but are not
binding on a court in the Cayman Islands. The rights of our shareholders and the fiduciary responsibilities of our directors under
Cayman Islands law are different from what they would be under statutes or judicial precedent in some jurisdictions in the United
States. In particular, the Cayman Islands has a different body of securities laws as compared to the United States, and certain
states, such as Delaware, may have more fully developed and judicially interpreted bodies of corporate law. In addition, Cayman
Islands companies may not have standing to initiate a shareholders derivative action in a Federal court of the United States.</P>

companies like the company have no general rights under Cayman Islands law to inspect corporate records or to obtain copies of
the register of members of these companies. Our directors have discretion under our amended and restated memorandum and articles
of association to determine whether or not, and under what conditions, our corporate records may be inspected by our shareholders,
but are not obliged to make them available to our shareholders. This may make it more difficult for you to obtain the information
needed to establish any facts necessary for a shareholder motion or to solicit proxies from other shareholders in connection with
a proxy contest.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">We have been advised by our Cayman Islands
legal counsel that the courts of the Cayman Islands are unlikely (i)&nbsp;to recognize or enforce against us judgments of courts
of the United States predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States or any
state; and (ii)&nbsp;in original actions brought in the Cayman Islands, to impose liabilities against us predicated upon the civil
liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States or any state, so far as the liabilities imposed by those
provisions are penal in nature. In those circumstances, although there is no statutory enforcement in the Cayman Islands of judgments
obtained in the United States, the courts of the Cayman Islands will recognize and enforce a foreign money judgment of a foreign
court of competent jurisdiction without retrial on the merits based on the principle that a judgment of a competent foreign court
imposes upon the judgment debtor an obligation to pay the sum for which judgment has been given provided certain conditions are
met. For a foreign judgment to be enforced in the Cayman Islands, such judgment must be final and conclusive and for a liquidated
sum, and must not be in respect of taxes or a fine or penalty, inconsistent with a Cayman Islands judgment in respect of the same
matter, impeachable on the grounds of fraud or obtained in a manner, or be of a kind the enforcement of which is, contrary to natural
justice or the public policy of the Cayman Islands (awards of punitive or multiple damages may well be held to be contrary to public
policy). A Cayman Islands Court may stay enforcement proceedings if concurrent proceedings are being brought elsewhere.</P>

combination only holders of our Class&nbsp;B ordinary shares, which have been issued to our sponsor, are entitled to vote on the
appointment of directors, which may make more difficult the removal of management and may discourage transactions that otherwise

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: left">We are a blank check company incorporated
in the Cayman Islands on November&nbsp;18, 2020 formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, amalgamation, share exchange, asset
acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or other similar Business Combination with one or more businesses. We intend to effectuate
our Business Combination using cash derived from the proceeds of our initial public offering and the private placement with our
sponsor, our shares, debt or a combination of cash, shares and debt.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">We expect to continue to incur significant

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: left">We have neither engaged in any operations
nor generated any operating revenues to date. Our only activities from inception through December&nbsp;31, 2020 were organizational
activities and those necessary to prepare for our initial public offering, described below. We do not expect to generate any operating
revenues until after the completion of our initial business combination. We expect to generate non-operating income in the form
of interest income on marketable securities held after our initial public offering. We expect that we will incur increased expenses
as a result of being a public company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting and auditing compliance), as well as for due
diligence expenses in connection with searching for, and completing, a business combination.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">As of December&nbsp;31, 2020, we had no
cash. Until the consummation of the Initial Public Offering, our only source of liquidity was an initial purchase of ordinary shares
by the sponsor and loans from our sponsor.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: left">On January&nbsp;29, 2021, we consummated
our initial public offering of 20,700,000 Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares, at a price of $10.00 per share, which included the full
exercise by the underwriters of their over-allotment option in the amount of 2,700,000 Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares, generating
gross proceeds of $207,000,000. Simultaneously with the closing of our initial public offering, we consummated the sale of 614,000
private placement shares to the sponsor at a price of $10.00 per share generating gross proceeds of $6,140,000.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: left">Following the closing of our initial public
offering, the full exercise of the over-allotment option, and the sale of the private placement shares, a total of $207,000,000
was placed in the trust account. We incurred $11,928,907 in transaction costs, including $4,140,000 of underwriting fees, $7,245,000
of deferred underwriting fees and $543,907 of other offering costs.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: left">We intend to use substantially all of the
funds held in the trust account, including any amounts representing interest earned on the trust account, which interest shall
be net of taxes payable and excluding deferred underwriting commissions, to complete our initial business combination. We may withdraw
interest from the trust account to pay taxes, if any. To the extent that our share capital or debt is used, in whole or in part,
as consideration to complete a business combination, the remaining proceeds held in the trust account will be used as working capital
to finance the operations of the target business or businesses, make other acquisitions and pursue our growth strategies.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: left">We intend to use the funds held outside
the trust account primarily to identify and evaluate target businesses, perform business due diligence on prospective target businesses,
travel to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses or their representatives or owners,
review corporate documents and material agreements of prospective target businesses, structure, negotiate and complete a business
combination.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: left">In order to fund working capital deficiencies
or finance transaction costs in connection with a business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor or certain of
our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required. If we complete a business combination,
we may repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust account released to us. In the event that a business combination
does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts, but no
proceeds from our trust account would be used for such repayment. Up to $1,500,000 of such loans may be convertible into shares
of the post-business combination entity, at a price of $10.00 per share, at the option of the lender. The shares would be identical
to the private placement shares.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: left">We do not believe we will need to raise
additional funds in order to meet the expenditures required for operating our business. However, if our estimate of the costs of
identifying a target business, undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating a business combination are less than the actual
amount necessary to do so, we may have insufficient funds available to operate our business prior to our initial business combination.
Moreover, we may need to obtain additional financing either to complete our business combination or because we become obligated
to redeem a significant number of our public shares upon completion of our business combination, in which case we may issue additional
securities or incur debt in connection with such business combination.</P>

which would be considered off-balance sheet arrangements as of December&nbsp;31, 2020. We do not participate in transactions that
create relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, often referred to as variable interest entities, which
would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements. We have not entered into any off-balance
sheet financing arrangements, established any special purpose entities, guaranteed any debt or commitments of other entities, or
purchased any non-financial assets.</P>

and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and income and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could
materially differ from those estimates. We have not identified any critical accounting policies.</P>

<P STYLE="text-align: left; font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">Disclosure controls are procedures that
are designed with the objective of ensuring that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act,
such as this Report, is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time period specified in the SEC&rsquo;s rules&nbsp;and
forms. Disclosure controls are also designed with the objective of ensuring that such information is accumulated and communicated
to our management, including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure. Our management evaluated, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal
financial and accounting officer (our &ldquo;Certifying Officers&rdquo;), the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures
as of December&nbsp;31, 2020, pursuant to Rule&nbsp;13a-15(b)&nbsp;under the Exchange Act. Based upon that evaluation, our Certifying
Officers concluded that, as of December&nbsp;31, 2020, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.</P>

<P STYLE="text-align: left; font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">We do not expect that our disclosure controls
and procedures will prevent all errors and all instances of fraud. Disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived
and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures
are met. Further, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and
the benefits must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all disclosure controls and procedures,
no evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures can provide absolute assurance that we have detected all our control deficiencies
and instances of fraud, if any. The design of disclosure controls and procedures also is based partly on certain assumptions about
the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under
all potential future conditions.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">Cayman Islands law does not limit the extent
to which a company&rsquo;s memorandum and articles of association may provide for indemnification of officers and directors, except
to the extent any such provision may be held by the Cayman Islands courts to be contrary to public policy, such as to provide indemnification
against willful default, willful neglect, civil fraud or the consequences of committing a crime. Our amended and restated memorandum
and articles of association  provide for indemnification of our officers and directors to the maximum extent permitted by law,
including for any liability incurred in their capacities as such, except through their own actual fraud, willful default or willful
neglect. We will enter into agreements with our directors and officers to provide contractual indemnification in addition to the
indemnification provided for in our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association. We expect to purchase a policy
of directors&rsquo; and officers&rsquo; liability insurance that insures our officers and directors against the cost of defense,
settlement or payment of a judgment in some circumstances and insures us against our obligations to indemnify our officers and
directors.</P>

waive any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies in the trust account, and have agreed to waive any right,
title, interest or claim of any kind they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any services provided to us
and will not seek recourse against the trust account for any reason whatsoever (except to the extent they are entitled to funds
from the trust account due to their ownership of public shares). Accordingly, any indemnification provided will only be able to
be satisfied by us if (i)&nbsp;we have sufficient funds outside of the trust account or (ii)&nbsp;we consummate an initial business
combination.</P>

shareholders from bringing a lawsuit against our officers or directors for breach of their fiduciary duty. These provisions also
may have the effect of reducing the likelihood of derivative litigation against our officers and directors, even though such an
action, if successful, might otherwise benefit us and our shareholders. Furthermore, a shareholder&rsquo;s investment may be adversely
affected to the extent we pay the costs of settlement and damage awards against our officers and directors pursuant to these indemnification
provisions.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">None of our executive officers or directors
have received any cash compensation for services rendered to the Company. Since the consummation of our initial public offering
and until the earlier of the consummation of the initial business combination and the Company&rsquo;s liquidation, we will reimburse
the Sponsor for office space, secretarial and administrative services provided to the company in an amount not to exceed $10,000
per month. In addition, our sponsor, executive officers and directors, or any of their respective affiliates are being reimbursed
for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with activities conducted on our behalf such as identifying potential target
businesses and performing due diligence on suitable business combinations. Our audit committee reviews all payments that the Company
makes to the sponsor, executive officers or directors, or their affiliates on a quarterly basis. Any such payments prior to an
initial business combination are made using funds held outside the trust account. Other than quarterly audit committee review of
such reimbursements, the company does not have any additional controls in place for governing reimbursement payments to its directors
and executive officers for their out-of-pocket expenses incurred on behalf of the company and in connection with identifying and
consummating an initial business combination. Other than these payments and reimbursements, no compensation of any kind, including
finder&rsquo;s and consulting fees, is paid by the company to our sponsor, executive officers and directors, or any of their respective
affiliates, prior to completion of the initial business combination.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">After the completion of our initial business
combination, directors or members of our management team who remain with us may be paid consulting or management fees from the
combined company. All of these fees will be fully disclosed to shareholders, to the extent then known, in the proxy solicitation
materials or tender offer materials furnished to our shareholders in connection with a proposed business combination. We have not
established any limit on the amount of such fees that may be paid by the combined company to our directors or members of management.
It is unlikely the amount of such compensation will be known at the time of the proposed business combination, because the directors
of the post-combination business will be responsible for determining executive officer and director compensation. Any compensation
to be paid to our executive officers will be determined, or recommended to the board of directors for determination, either by
a compensation committee constituted solely by independent directors or by a majority of the independent directors on our board
of directors.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">We do not intend to take any action to ensure
that members of our management team maintain their positions with us after the consummation of our initial business combination,
although it is possible that some or all of our executive officers and directors may remain directors or negotiate employment or
consulting arrangements to remain with us after our initial business combination. The existence or terms of any such employment
or consulting arrangements to retain their positions with us may influence our management&rsquo;s motivation in identifying or
selecting a target business but we do not believe that the ability of our management to remain with us after the consummation of
our initial business combination will be a determining factor in our decision to proceed with any potential business combination.
We are not party to any agreements with our executive officers and directors that provide for benefits upon termination of employment.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">On November&nbsp;24, 2020, we issued 4,312,500
founder shares to our sponsor in exchange for a capital contribution of $25,000, or approximately $0.006 per share. On January&nbsp;26,
2021, we effected a share capitalization pursuant to which we issued 862,500 additional Class&nbsp;B ordinary shares, resulting
in our initial shareholders holding 5,175,000 Class&nbsp;B ordinary shares. In December&nbsp;2020, our sponsor transferred 35,000
Class&nbsp;B ordinary shares to each of Dr.&nbsp;Wolfgang and Mr.&nbsp;Weinstein for their service as independent directors. In
January&nbsp;2021, our sponsor transferred 35,000 Class&nbsp;B ordinary shares to Mr.&nbsp;Harris for his service as an independent
director. These 105,000 founder shares were not subject to forfeiture from the exercise of the underwriter&rsquo;s over-allotment
exercise. The number of founder shares issued was determined based on the expectation that such founder shares would represent
20% of the issued and outstanding shares (excluding the private placement shares) upon completion of our initial public offering.
675,000 founder shares held by our sponsor were forfeited by our sponsor due to the exercise of the underwriter&rsquo;s over-allotment
option. The founder shares (including the Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise thereof) may not, subject to certain
limited exceptions, be transferred, assigned or sold by the holder.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">Our sponsor purchased 614,000 private placement
shares for a purchase price of $10.00 per share in a private placement that will occurred simultaneously with the closing of our
initial public offering. As such, our sponsor&rsquo;s interest in this transaction is valued at $6,140,000. The private placement
shares may not, subject to certain limited exceptions, be transferred, assigned or sold by the holder until 30&nbsp;days after
the completion of our initial business combination.</P>

aware of a business combination opportunity that falls within the line of business of any entity to which he or she has then-current
fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she will honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such opportunity
to such entity. Our officers and directors currently have certain relevant fiduciary duties or contractual obligations that may

are first listed on the Nasdaq. Upon completion of our initial business combination or our liquidation, we will cease paying these
monthly fees.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">No compensation of any kind, including finder&rsquo;s
and consulting fees, will be paid to our sponsor, officers and directors, or any of their respective affiliates, for services rendered
prior to or in connection with the completion of an initial business combination. However, these individuals will be reimbursed
for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with activities on our behalf such as identifying potential target businesses
and performing due diligence on suitable business combinations. Our audit committee will review on a quarterly basis all payments
that were made by us to our sponsor, officers, directors or our or their affiliates and will determine which expenses and the amount
of expenses that will be reimbursed. There is no cap or ceiling on the reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses incurred by such
persons in connection with activities on our behalf.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">In addition, in order to finance transaction
costs in connection with an intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor or certain of our
officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required. If we complete an initial business combination,
we may repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust account released to us. In the event that the initial business
combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts
but no proceeds from our trust account would be used for such repayment. Up to $1,500,000 of such loans may be convertible into
shares at a price of $10.00 per share at the option of the lender. The shares would be identical to the private placement shares.
The terms of such loans by our officers and directors, if any, have not been determined and no written agreements exist with respect
to such loans. We do not expect to seek loans from parties other than our sponsor, members of our management team or any of their
affiliates as we do not believe third parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights
to seek access to funds in our trust account.</P>

with the consummation of our initial business combination. The funds from such private placement would be used as part of the consideration
to the sellers in our initial business combination, and any excess funds from such private placement would be used for working
capital in the post-business combination company. However, because indications of interest are not binding agreements or commitments
to purchase, our sponsor may determine not to purchase any such shares, or to purchase fewer shares than it has indicated an interest
in purchasing. Furthermore, we are not under any obligation to sell any such shares. Such investment would be made on terms and
conditions determined at the time of the business combination.</P>

changes in shareholder&rsquo;s equity and cash flows for the period from November 18, 2020 (inception) through December 31, 2020,
and the related notes (collectively referred to as the &ldquo;financial statements&rdquo;). In our opinion, the financial statements

operations and its cash flows for the period from November 18, 2020 (inception) through December 31, 2020, in conformity with accounting

of the Company&rsquo;s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company&rsquo;s financial statements based
on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (the

laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: left">We conducted our audit in accordance with
the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have,
nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit, we are required
to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Company&rsquo;s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: left">Our audit included performing procedures
to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures
that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures
in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
basis for our opinion.</P>

the full exercise by the underwriter of its over-allotment option in the amount of 2,700,000 Public Shares, at $10.00 per Public

that together have a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the net assets held in the Trust Account (excluding deferred underwriting
commissions and taxes payable on the interest earned on the Trust Account) at the time of the agreement to enter into a Business
Combination. The Company will only complete a Business Combination if the post-Business Combination company owns or acquires 50%
or more of the issued and outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target
business sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act.</P>

either (i)&nbsp;in connection with a shareholder meeting called to approve the Business Combination or (ii)&nbsp;by means of a

offer will be made by the Company. The shareholders will be entitled to redeem their shares for a pro&nbsp;rata portion of the
amount held in the Trust Account (initially $10.00 per share), calculated as of two business days prior to the completion of a
Business Combination, including any pro&nbsp;rata interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released

completion of the Company's initial business combination, (ii) the redemption of the public shares if the Company has not
consummated an initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of our initial public offering, subject to applicable
law, and (iii) the redemption of the public shares properly submitted in connection with a shareholder vote to approve an amendment
to the Company's amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (A) that would modify the substance or timing of its

does not decide to hold a shareholder vote for business or other reasons, the Company will, pursuant to its Amended and Restated
Memorandum and Articles of Association, conduct the redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules&nbsp;of the Securities and Exchange
Commission (&ldquo;SEC&rdquo;), and file tender offer documents containing substantially the same information as would be included
in a proxy statement with the SEC prior to completing a Business Combination. If the Company seeks shareholder approval in connection
with a Business Combination, the Sponsor has agreed to vote its Founder Shares (as defined in Note 5), its Private Placement Shares
(as defined in Note&nbsp;5), and any Public Shares purchased in or after the Initial Public Offering in favor of approving a Business
Combination and to waive its redemption rights with respect to any such shares in connection with a shareholder vote to approve
a Business Combination. However, in no event will the Company redeem its Public Shares in an amount that would cause its net tangible
assets to be less than $5,000,001. Additionally, each public shareholder may elect to redeem its Public Shares, without voting,

Note 6) held in the Trust Account in the event the Company does not complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period
and, in such event, such amounts will be included with the funds held in the Trust Account that will be available to fund the

reduce the amount of funds in the Trust Account to below (1)&nbsp;$10.00 per Public Share or (2)&nbsp;such lesser amount per Public
Share held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account due to reductions in the value of trust
assets, in each case net of the amount of interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes. This liability will not apply with respect
to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the Trust Account nor will it apply
to any claims under the Company&rsquo;s indemnity of the underwriters of the Initial Public Offering against certain liabilities,
including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the &ldquo;Securities Act&rdquo;). Moreover, in the event that
an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, the Sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any
liability for such third-party claims. The Company will seek to reduce the possibility that the Sponsor will have to indemnify
the Trust Account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers (other than the Company&rsquo;s
independent public accountants), prospective target businesses or other entities with which the Company does business, execute
agreements with the Company waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the Trust Account.</P>

that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required
to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley

of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards
until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not
have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting
standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements
that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. The Company has elected not to opt
out of such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates
for public or private companies, the Company, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time
private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of the Company&rsquo;s financial statements with
another public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using
the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.</P>

for income taxes under ASC 740, &ldquo;Income Taxes&rdquo; (&ldquo;ASC 740&rdquo;). ASC 740 requires the recognition of deferred
tax assets and liabilities for both the expected impact of differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets
and liabilities and for the expected future tax benefit to be derived from tax loss and tax credit carry forwards. ASC 740 additionally
requires a valuation allowance to be established when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will
not be realized.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: left; text-indent: 16.2pt">ASC 740 also clarifies
the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise&rsquo;s financial statements and prescribes a recognition
threshold and measurement process for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be
taken in a tax return. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon examination
by taxing authorities. The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax
expense. There were no unrecognized tax benefits and no amounts accrued for interest and penalties as of December 31, 2020. The
Company is currently not aware of any issues under review that could result in significant payments, accruals or material deviation
from its position. The Company is subject to income tax examinations by major taxing authorities since inception.</P>

is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period, excluding ordinary

or converted into ordinary shares and then share in the earnings of the Company. As a result, diluted loss per share is the same
as basic loss per share for the period presented.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">Ordinary shareholders of record are entitled to
one vote for each share held on all matters to be voted on by shareholders. Except as described below, holders of Class&nbsp;A ordinary
shares and holders of Class&nbsp;B ordinary shares will vote together as a single class on all matters submitted to a vote of our shareholders
except as required by law. Unless specified in our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, or as required by applicable
provisions of the Companies Act or applicable stock exchange rules, the affirmative vote of a majority of our ordinary shares that are
voted is required to approve any such matter voted on by our shareholders. Approval of certain actions requires a special resolution
under Cayman Islands law, being the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of our ordinary shares that are voted, and pursuant to our
amended and restated memorandum and articles of association; such actions include amending our amended and restated memorandum and articles
of association and approving a statutory merger or consolidation with another company. Our board of directors is divided into three classes,
each of which will generally serve for terms of three&nbsp;years with only one class of directors being elected in each year. There is
no cumulative voting with respect to the appointment of directors, with the result that the holders of more than 50% of the shares voted
for the appointment of directors can appoint all of the directors. Our shareholders are entitled to receive ratable dividends when, as
and if declared by the board of directors out of funds legally available therefor. Prior to our initial business combination, only holders
of our founder shares will have the right to vote on the appointment of directors. Holders of our public shares will not be entitled
to vote on the appointment of directors during such time. In addition, prior to the completion of an initial business combination, holders
of a majority of our founder shares may remove a member of the board of directors for any reason. The provisions of our amended and restated
memorandum and articles of association governing the appointment or removal of directors prior to our initial business combination may
only be amended by a special resolution passed by holders representing at least two-thirds of our outstanding Class&nbsp;B ordinary shares.</P>

shares which we are authorized to issue at the same time as our shareholders vote on the business combination to the extent we seek shareholder

with only one class of directors being elected in each year and each class (except for those directors appointed prior to our first annual
general meeting) serving a three-year term. In accordance with Nasdaq corporate governance requirements, we are not required to hold an
annual meeting until one year after our first fiscal year end following our listing on Nasdaq. As an exempted company, there is no requirement
under the Companies Act for us to hold annual or general meetings to appoint directors. We may not hold an annual general meeting to appoint
new directors prior to the consummation of our initial business combination. Prior to the completion of an initial business combination,
any vacancy on the board of directors may be filled by a nominee chosen by holders of a majority of our founder shares. In addition, prior
to the completion of an initial business combination, holders of a majority of our founder shares may remove a member of the board of
directors for any reason.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">We will provide our public shareholders with the
opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their public shares upon the completion of our initial business combination at a per-share price,
payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account calculated as of two business days prior to the consummation
of our initial business combination, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us
to pay our income taxes, if any, divided by the number of the then-outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations described herein.
The amount in the trust account is initially anticipated to be $10.00 per public share. The per share amount we will distribute to investors
who properly redeem their shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions we will pay to the underwriter. The redemption
rights may include the requirement that a beneficial owner must identify itself in order to valid redeem its shares. Our sponsor and our
management team have entered into agreements with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect
to their founder shares, the private placement shares and any public shares purchased during or after our initial public offering in connection
with (i)&nbsp;the completion of our initial business combination and (ii)&nbsp;a shareholder vote to approve an amendment to our amended
and restated memorandum and articles of association (A)&nbsp;that would modify the substance or timing of our obligation to provide holders
of our Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares the right to have their shares redeemed in connection with our initial business combination or to
redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within 24&nbsp;months from the closing of our
initial public offering or (B)&nbsp;with respect to any other provision relating to the rights of holders of our Class&nbsp;A ordinary
shares or pre-initial business combination activity. Unlike many blank check companies that hold shareholder votes and conduct proxy solicitations
in conjunction with their initial business combinations and provide for related redemptions of public shares for cash upon completion
of such initial business combinations even when a vote is not required by law, if a shareholder vote is not required by applicable law
or stock exchange rule and we do not decide to hold a shareholder vote for business or other reasons, we will, pursuant to our amended
and restated memorandum and articles of association, conduct the redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC, and file tender
offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our initial business combination. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of
association requires these tender offer documents to contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial
business combination and the redemption rights as is required under the SEC&rsquo;s proxy rules. If, however, a shareholder approval of
the transaction is required by applicable law or stock exchange rule, or we decide to obtain shareholder approval for business or other
reasons, we will, like many blank check companies, offer to redeem shares in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to the proxy
rules and not pursuant to the tender offer rules. If we seek shareholder approval, we will complete our initial business combination only
if a majority of the ordinary shares, represented in person or by proxy and entitled to vote thereon, voted at a general meeting are voted
in favor of the business combination. However, the participation of our sponsor, officers, directors, advisors or their affiliates in
privately-negotiated transactions, if any, could result in the approval of our initial business combination even if a majority of our
public shareholders vote, or indicate their intention to vote, against such initial business combination unless restricted by applicable
Nasdaq rules. For purposes of seeking approval of the majority of our issued and outstanding ordinary shares, non-votes will have no effect
on the approval of our initial business combination once a quorum is obtained. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association
require that at least five days&rsquo; notice will be given of any general meeting.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">If we seek shareholder approval of our initial
business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer
rules, our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provides that a public shareholder, together with any affiliate
of such shareholder or any other person with whom such shareholder is acting in concert or as a &ldquo;group&rdquo; (as defined under
Section&nbsp;13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to Excess Shares, without our prior consent.
However, we would not be restricting our shareholders&rsquo; ability to vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares) for or against
our initial business combination. Our shareholders&rsquo; inability to redeem the Excess Shares will reduce their influence over our ability
to complete our initial business combination, and such shareholders could suffer a material loss in their investment if they sell such
Excess Shares on the open market. Additionally, such shareholders will not receive redemption distributions with respect to the Excess
Shares if we complete our initial business combination. And, as a result, such shareholders will continue to hold that number of shares
exceeding 15% and, in order to dispose such shares would be required to sell their shares in open market transactions, potentially at
a loss.</P>

shareholder must give his written objection to the merger or consolidation to the constituent company before the vote on the merger or
consolidation, including a statement that the shareholder proposes to demand payment for his shares if the merger or consolidation is
authorized by the vote; (b)&nbsp;within 20&nbsp;days following the date on which the merger or consolidation is approved by the shareholders,
the constituent company must give written notice to each shareholder who made a written objection; (c)&nbsp;a shareholder must within
20&nbsp;days following receipt of such notice from the constituent company, give the constituent company a written notice of his intention
to dissent including, among other details, a demand for payment of the fair value of his shares; (d)&nbsp;within seven days following
the date of the expiration of the period set out in paragraph (b)&nbsp;above or seven days following the date on which the plan of merger
or consolidation is filed, whichever is later, the constituent company, the surviving company or the consolidated company must make a
written offer to each dissenting shareholder to purchase his shares at a price that the company determines is the fair value and if the
company and the shareholder agree the price within 30&nbsp;days following the date on which the offer was made, the company must pay the
shareholder such amount; and (e)&nbsp;if the company and the shareholder fail to agree a price within such 30 day period, within 20&nbsp;days
following the date on which such 30 day period expires, the company (and any dissenting shareholder) must file a petition with the Cayman
Islands Grand Court to determine the fair value and such petition must be accompanied by a list of the names and addresses of the dissenting
shareholders with whom agreements as to the fair value of their shares have not been reached by the company. At the hearing of that petition,
the court has the power to determine the fair value of the shares together with a fair rate of interest, if any, to be paid by the company
upon the amount determined to be the fair value. Any dissenting shareholder whose name appears on the list filed by the company may participate
fully in all proceedings until the determination of fair value is reached. These rights of a dissenting shareholder are not available
in certain circumstances, for example, to dissenters holding shares of any class in respect of which an open market exists on a recognized
stock exchange or recognized interdealer quotation system at the relevant date or where the consideration for such shares to be contributed
are shares of any company listed on a national securities exchange or shares of the surviving or consolidated company.</P>

provisions that facilitate the reconstruction or amalgamation of companies in certain circumstances, schemes of arrangement will generally
be more suited for complex mergers or other transactions involving widely held companies, commonly referred to in the Cayman Islands as
a &ldquo;scheme of arrangement&rdquo; which may be tantamount to a merger. In the event that a merger was sought pursuant to a scheme
of arrangement (the procedures for which are more rigorous and take longer to complete than the procedures typically required to consummate
a merger in the United States), the arrangement in question must be approved by a majority in number of each class of shareholders and
creditors with whom the arrangement is to be made and who must in addition represent three-fourths in value of each such class of shareholders
or creditors, as the case may be, that are present and voting either in person or by proxy at a meeting, or meeting summoned for that
purpose. The convening of the meetings and subsequently the terms of the arrangement must be sanctioned by the Grand Court of the Cayman
Islands. While a dissenting shareholder would have the right to express to the court the view that the transaction should not be approved,
the court can be expected to approve the arrangement if it satisfies itself that:</P>

provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States or any state, so far as the liabilities imposed by those provisions are
penal in nature. In those circumstances, although there is no statutory enforcement in the Cayman Islands of judgments obtained in the
United States, the courts of the Cayman Islands will recognize and enforce a foreign money judgment of a foreign court of competent jurisdiction
without retrial on the merits based on the principle that a judgment of a competent foreign court imposes upon the judgment debtor an
obligation to pay the sum for which judgment has been given provided certain conditions are met. For a foreign judgment to be enforced
in the Cayman Islands, such judgment must be final and conclusive and for a liquidated sum, and must not be in respect of taxes or a fine

in a manner, and or be of a kind the enforcement of which is, contrary to natural justice or the public policy of the Cayman Islands (awards
of punitive or multiple damages may well be held to be contrary to public policy). A Cayman Islands Court may stay enforcement proceedings
