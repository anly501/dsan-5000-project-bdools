# **Ben Doolan**

Ben Doolan is a senior at Georgetown University, majoring in Physics and Classics, while pursuing a Master of Science in Data Science & Analytics through Georgetown's accelerated DSAN program. This summer, Ben worked at EY-Parthenon, a management consulting firm, out of their San Francisco office. There, he worked with a large private equity client, helping restructure a portfolio company's IT spend as part of a technology transformation. The prior two summers, Ben worked as a data intern at L Catterton, a consumer focused private equity firm. In the future, Ben hopes to explore the intersection of physics, statistics, medicine, biology, and computer science in their application to the life sciences. In particular, he'd to examine how statistical and machine learning techniques can be applied to improve the predictive capabilities of Continuous Glucose Monitors for Type 1 Diabetes management. In his free time, Ben enjoy reading, visiting museums, and discussing politics and current affairs.

# Guiding Quotes

> There are, on the other hand, two kinds of injustice — the one, on the part of those who inflict wrong, the other on the part of those who, when they can, do not shield from wrong those upon whom it is being inflicted.[^1]

> “A nation can survive its fools, and even the ambitious. But it cannot survive treason from within. An enemy at the gates is less formidable, for he is known and carries his banner openly. But the traitor moves amongst those within the gate freely, his sly whispers rustling through all the alleys, heard in the very halls of government itself. For the traitor appears not a traitor; he speaks in accents familiar to his victims, and he wears their face and their arguments, he appeals to the baseness that lies deep in the hearts of all men. He rots the soul of a nation, he works secretly and unknown in the night to undermine the pillars of the city, he infects the body politic so that it can no longer resist. A murderer is less to fear. The traitor is the plague.” [^2]

> “I would not be beholden to a tyrant, for his acts of tyranny. For it is but usurpation in him to save, as their rightful lord, the lives of men over whom he has no title to reign”[^3]
