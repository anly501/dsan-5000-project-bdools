Specifically, I found my medical device dataset under the [**510k header**](https://open.fda.gov/data/downloads/) header of the [**openFDA**](https://open.fda.gov/) site. The dataset is a JSON file that contains information about medical devices in the inital filing process for approval to the FDA once the company believes their device is ready to go to market. The dataset contains information about the device, the company, the approval process, and the device's intended use. The dataset is updated daily and contains over 100,000 records.\n",
