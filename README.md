# DSAN-5000-project-bdools
* Here's my exploratory data analysis repo for my first semeter project in DSAN 5000 
* In my project, I am examining FDA 510(k) data in tandem with SEC 10-K filings for public companies in order to examine whether there are any relationships between financial performance of companies and the industries/categories they develop devices for.
* In my repo, you will see folders for each section of my webpage. Inside each folder, you will find a code folder, which contains the jupyter notebook for that page, as well as an outputs folder, which contains any relevant outputs from the notebook.
* I have placed a copies of my original data in a google drive folder that you can access here: [Data]https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-H9c243q2D5CB6wgZD7c40CGSjNJjs4s?usp=sharing
